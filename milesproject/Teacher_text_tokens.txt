and you look at all the names of the polymers, what's at the beginning of all the names of the [//] of the chemical names of the polymers? ?
yeah, they're simple molecules, so if we take the simple molecules, daphne, we put them all together inside of a chain, what have we created? ?
and they're joined together, how are they joined together?
do you guys know what I'm talking about?
were they more arranged parallel or were they arranged crisscross? ?
do you think the chains are arranged parallel to one another or do you think they're crisscrossed? ?
scrunched together kinda like? ?
you kind of gave it to me, but kind of rephrase that.
are you talking about this thing right there? 
that's force, as in newtons. 
don't kill each other. 
go away, jeffrey.
what do you need, miguel?
did you go find audrey's stuff yet? 
are you planning on doing some rude symbol while my back is turned?
uh, you can actually draw a line through jack's name on there and, uh [//] was that it for this class that transferred to the high school? 
audrey, what are you doing going into other people's classrooms? 
what are you doing?
ladies? 
are you guys about finished or are you just goofing off? 
they just copied it all off of you instead of actually doing it?
miguel, sit down. 
audrey, put them away.
audrey, sit down.
cindy, could you go sit in your actual seat? 
cindy, can you wash that off your hand, please. 
pass that one back to matt, would you?
audrey, put that away or I'm gonna read it out loud to everybody. 
stop. 
stop.
gather your stuff.
let's go, folks. 
come on, you guys. 
let's go.
come on, miguel.
just wait. 
stay away. 
come here.
come on, you guys.
come on, Ian. 
carly, watch your mouth, please. 
matt, find your seat. 
can you do that for me, please.
I need your attention up here, please.
folks, I need your attention up here, please.
I'm glad you guys are having so much fun coloring inside the letters, but if I could get your attention up here, I would really appreciate it. 
come here. 
you need to sit down.
you need to write down tonight's homework assignment. 
I hate when you guys do that.
cindy, once it's washed off, you can sit down. 
every single day I would like you to act like perfect kids.
if today is the best you can do for being perfect, i'll take it. 
you're standing there with the door wide open. 
hey, folks. 
oh, that's so helpful.
okay, folks.
that's enough, Miguel. 
you guys remember the polymer, the newspaper polymer, do you guys remember that? ?
do you guys remember that? ?
poly means many. 
you can use this for a test.
they're gigantic molecules. 
mono means one. 
mono [//] okay, polymers are molecules joined together. 
they're around one another and they're linked together. 
thank you, a chain.
okay, we can write: mer@k. 
I was trying to kinda remember, remember “molecule” okay? ?
kinda like crisscrossed. 
you could rip it very, very easily. 
get what? 
yes? 
okay? 
fifty to sixty four is ten? 
so it would have been fourteen centimeters, right?
but you're gonna find that for most of the pull setups it's not the same, okay? 
yeah. 
that's the plan.
okay. 
there you go.
cool. 
okay. 
okay, that's cool. 
I see. 
I see. 
yeah. 
that's it.
that's it.
yeah. 
okay, thanks. 
uh, yes. 
yes, thank you.
there we go.
okay. 
okay. 
okay. 
okay. 
that would be fine. 
that [//] that's fine.
there it is right there. 
and you're all set. 
sure. 
okay. 
okay. 
that's it. 
so there you go.
okay. 
that's great. 
okay. 
that would be fine.
okay. 
all right. 
yep. 
yeah. 
yep. 
all right.
okay. 
yep. 
that's fine.
yeah, that's effort distance.
okay. 
yeah. 
that's it.
that's cool.
yes, ma'am. 
what is a monomer?
so mono means what?
what are they linked together in, samantha?
and then how's the other one?
that's your monomeer, you take a whole bunch of monomers together and what have you created? ?
does anybody here know what tetra means?
anybody here know what “tetra” means? ?
but give me kind of a definition of a monomer
which one is number one, justin? 
which one of those is number one?
well, the little ones are what? 
that's effort force.
not duct tape, plumber's tape.
and what's so important about mono?
they were parallel and because they were arranged parallel what could you what could you do to the newspaper? ?
and how were the molecules arranged in the tyvek?
they're crisscross, and what did the crisscross molecules do to the tyvek? ?
and how that kinda helps us determine what is ac [//] actually gonna happen to the polymer; how is the polymer gonna behave? ?
what about over here on this side of the room? ?
why? 
what did you leave it up there for?
so what's the difference between fifty seven and forty one? 
so they come in two kinds, manmade and natural. 
okay, tetra is a number.
usually what happens up in here is that they'll actually tell you how many of those, uh, molecules are actually bonded together. 
and, that's what I use it for, to fix gas leaks and also it's really, really good for uh, water pipes and threading things like that, too.
so it's how far you exert the force.
it's the distance over which you apply the effort.
that's what effort distance is. 
so if you start here and extend it that far, that's the effort distance. 
how far we pull this to lift the weight ten centimeters is our effort distance. 
you tie a loop in the string and pull down when you're lifting the weight up. 
so when that's being lifted ten centimeters, you want to know how far you had to pull this down.
has anybody here ever fooled around with plumber's tape before? ?
jim, share your experiences with plumber's tape.
did that tell me anything about how the chains were?
someone in here raise your hand and tell me what you think this tells you about how the polymer chains are arranged. ?
what does this tell you? ?
then how come there's not a series of marks? 
i don't think so. 
no, you didn't. 
that's not how it works. 
no. 
now, do you see the tape? ?
does anybody want to take a look at the plumber's tape? ?
and tell me what happens. ?
touch it and you can actually see how flimsy this is, too.
see, it kinda makes a cute little ribbon. 
see these white spots here?
did you find [//] you didn't get one moving west.
somebody else?
do you remember?
okay, ladies and gents somebody in here raise your hand and tell me something that you've learned about polymers. ?
something that you know about polymers, based on last class period. ?
something that you know about polymers.
so, um, you learned about manmade versus natural polymers?
anybody else?
anything else you want to add to this?
do you remember?
can somebody here tell me how were the chains arranged in the newspaper?
how were the chains arranged?
okay, what was the other thing that we used in class?
you guys remember that when we kinda drew this picture of nylon last class period?
what [//] how did that newspaper behave? ?
how did the newspaper behave as far as tearing is concerned? ?
did you learn anything about how the chains were aligned in the tape? ?
because we had a minimum day that day so we took notes, and played around with two polymers. 
but with the ones that we talked about were in chains, okay? ?
samantha mentioned that the polymers can kind of in chains [//] can kinda be arranged two different ways. 
she said, “side to side” and we'll call that “parallel” today. 
we know the polymer chains can be arranged two different ways.
they can be arranged parallel to one another, or they can be arranged crisscross. 
that's what we used this morning for threading, water pipes and stuff like that. ?
just like gave you stuff, remember? 
like candy bars and sodas, remember? 
what is it for every experiment that we're doing? 
the resistance force is just how much the resistance weighs, and as you guys just said a second ago, we are measuring it in what? 
like we learned how to do on monday. 
I remember somebody paid like three thousand dollars for a cup of soup or something like that, remember, in the secret bags. 
remember the ones we rolled up and stapled shut. 
we went over this yesterday. 
we went over [//] we went over resistance distance.
the forces [//] I went over those yesterday. 
in other words, daphne, if I were to ask you what is a monomer, what would you tell me? ?
I mean if you have to describe what they look like when they were joined together what would you tell me? ?
but what's the resistance distance?
what are the little ones?
I have no idea what you are talking about. 
but if you want to take a whole bunch of monomers and link them together what have you kind of created? ?
but if I were to pull like this I would have my name &nice nice and original again; normal again. 
how far would that be?
how far would that be?
audrey, let's say you started there, and by the time that thing was ten centimeters off the ground you were here. How far did it move?
I started at fifty, I went down to forty four. how far did it move?
started at fifty, and I went to sixty four. how far did it go?
say, you started at fifty five, and you pulled the string down to sixty on the ruler. 
say, you started at fifty five, and it went to forty five.
if you pull straight down, you'll get much more accurate measurements.
if you do it off to the side, it just, uh [//] it's not gonna be as accurate, and again estimate to the closest quarter. 
it's just you have to pull a lot more string through if you put the [//] better bring the string through first.
you're getting it. 
well, you're really close.
don't worry about that yet. 
and I'm gonna see whether or not you guys can remember that. 
and we're gonna take this one step further today in class. 
we're gonna talk about parallel and cross linked chains and what actually does that do to the polymer. 
kind of a r [//] kind of a review from what we did last class period, but also to let you know where we're going with the lesson today. 
okay, this is what we're gonna concentrate on in class today.
and you're going to investigate a polymer on your own, with your group. 
actually, it just does it by, whe [//] eh, you're gonna figure that out. 
the job is now to figure out how the polymer chains are arranged. 
so we're gonna have to do a couple of things to it to try to figure out how the polymer chains are inside the teflon or inside the plumber's tape. ?
okay, and this, ladies and gents, is what we're gonna focus on today, okay? ?
so you put all of these together and you'll get them all in a nice big old polymer chain and you create plumber's tape. 
the only thing that I'd like for you to do with the plumber's tape when you get it, is just to kinda leave it on your desk. 
I'd just like to go out and get the sunspots real quick.
then I'm gonna pass out a piece of paper to you.
and i'll pass out compasses so that we can get the sun's shape drawn before we head outside. 
and it'll probably be about one thirty or twelve thirty when we have them set up out there. 
we'll all go back in in about a minute or so.
we're gonna get started on the lab today.
you'll be using both of them at the same time. 
one person is gonna be measuring resistance distance; one person is gonna be measuring effort distance. 
so you'll have one person using the centimeter side of the ruler. 
they're gonna be measuring how high the bottom of the weight goes up.
is gonna be measuring how far they have moved the string to raise the weight ten centimeters. 
a couple things to be aware of when you're doing your measurements. 
so you want to make sure that you're pulling straight down in the direction that you are measuring. 
secondly, you want to make sure that, uh, when you're measuring the force you're also pulling straight down. 
straight down really helps on this lab. 
and you're gonna pull, and it works again much better if you pull upside down. 
you're not gonna get them all done today. 
you might not even get the first one done today.
it's better that you get accurate data than that you just rush through all of these. 
we're gonna spend a number of days on this. 
at this time I'm gonna divide you up into ten groups and send you to a station.
get started on [//] well, you can do any of the pulley setups you want. 
it doesn't matter whether you start with the first one or not, but let me sort of divide you guys up here. 
um, diane, you guys are gonna be here on the other side of this first station.
cassandra, you guys will be on this side of the first station. 
carly, you guys will be across from matt's group. 
audrey, you guys will be at this third station over here.
you guys will be just across from that. 
sheila and eleanor, you guys will be where cindy is, working at that station. 
and, josh and muriel, you'll be just across from that. 
and [//] let's see [//] andrew and zeb, you guys will be at this station back here, and you guys will be at the very last station on the end. 
we're gonna do that together once we got our data.
yes, I think that would be a wise idea. 
if I were you I'd kinda go over your notes a little bit, too. 
okay, well then you need to go and get the notes from somebody in class, okay? ?
to try to get as much information as you can about polymers because what can you do with this sheet of paper, that i'll let you do? ?
so what I'd like for you to do, is that you have the tape like this, lengthwise on your desk [//] everybody, jason, got it?
and if you would do me a favor and put your notebook on the floor, so the only thing that should be on your desk is a piece of notebook paper. ?
don't do anything to it other than just leave it on your desk. ?
then don't, don't do that, then if it's ripping through, cause it's not a good thing. ?
don't stretch it out to the point where you're gonna tear it, but go along your tape and ever so gently stretch it out. ?
now what I want you to do, is take one end and take the other end and I want you ever so gently to stretch it that way. ?
okay, do I have any others of these pages? 
did we get them tracked west?
so you guys haven't done yours yet?
where's yours? 
are we gonna mark our sunspots and track them west?
where did you start? 
where did you end?
depending on how you turned, how far would that be? 
is there anything over fifty? 
how did you get effort distance on there, zeb? 
which one? 
you're supposed to actually measure some stuff along the way, and what would that be? 
what's that? 
and how far are you supposed to lift it? 
how far did it move? 
which part are you guys stuck on here?
can I have any others?
write down tonight's homework assignment. 
on page one forty nine, I'd like you to do questions one through four, please. 
and as always write out the questions and the answers.
take two, pass it back. 
take two, and pass the rest back. 
set the compass at four and a half centimeters, please. 
separate them in two halves, take about an inch off the bottom, please. 
draw your sun circle about in the center. 
fold it in half, turn. 
please do both circles because I don't want to have to do this again tomorrow.
let's get them separated, get the covers off, and find a space in the sun.
okay, put circles on both data pieces, today and tomorrow. 
put sunspots at the top, name, date, and the period, and the time of twelve thirty, which is about when we will be out there. 
tops off.
let's get the stands from the telescopes and head on out.
bring them outside.
find a spot in the sun.
mark your sunspots and track one moving west, please. 
please be careful with them. 
please mark your sunspots and track one of them moving west. 
you need to track one of them moving west. 
you got to mark them, and that way will show you the direction west.
you got to mark not only your sunspots.
you also have to track them moving west so you know which way your image is oriented so please track one of your sunspots moving west. 
let's get your telescopes and bring them back in. 
put them together, get the covers on, bring them back up to my desk. 
let's get them back together, cases on. 
bring them up front.
justin, would you collect all the compasses? 
please send the compasses to the front of the room so justin can pick those up. 
I need you guys to take out the lab sheet that we went over yesterday, please. 
folks, get your labs.
find your spots, please.
just quickly go over this for the first setup again. 
don't use the inches; use the centimeters. 
pull straight down. 
let's head to our stations.
take your data table.
let's get them set up and get to work.
go ahead and put fifty on there. 
you're gonna want to get those out. 
you probably want to put the loop through. 
you got to measure [/] measure it while you do it, audrey. 
tie a knot in the string. 
pull it with the scale. 
read the reading in newtons.
pass everything back.
weigh this thing.
lastly, lift this ten centimeters off the ground by pulling here.
any of these areas in the full sun is fine as long as you're not behind tree shadows.
it needs [//] monica, it needs a little adjustment just so it'll get it more centered. 
so can you tilt it left and right so that the shadow goes away
okay, now you got shadow on this side, okay? 
now you just need to tilt it a little bit to make [//] there you go.
now, you should be able to see spots here. 
if you line those up in the center of the target, you should have your sun.
all I need is in the center of the target, see.
now you need to mark them. 
the direction that the sunspots move. 
when you put it on there, you're supposed to let the sun move and make a mark for one of your sunspots as it moves. 
you're just gathering three pieces of data from each pulley setup. 
you're gathering the effort distance, the effort force and the resistance force. 
when you lift the weight by ten centimeters. 
the resistance distance in every case is ten centimeters. 
there are two rulers back at the station. 
when it's at ten centimeters, that's as far as you're going. 
now, some people in earlier classes were just writing down the numbers on here. 
but it has to be straight down, and you have to know where you started. 
but you got to hold it somewhere so that you can pull. 
p+o+l+y, poly, and that gives you a really, really good idea that that must be a polymer because it has p+o+l+y on it. 
so I'd start at something even. 
this is useful for your career
this relates to your interest
you will find this interesting
this is actually fun
you will find this fun
this will be on the test
there will be a quiz later on this
you need to know this for the test
you need to know this for the exam
this will be on the midterm
you should know this for the midterm
you need this to do well in this class
you should really know this if you care about your grade

look at me.
listen to me.
pay attention to me.
I need you to pay attention.
I need you to listen.
and you look at all the names of the polymers, what's at the beginning of all the names of the [//] of the chemical names of the polymers? ?
yeah, they're simple molecules, so if we take the simple molecules, daphne, we put them all together inside of a chain, what have we created? ?
and they're joined together, how are they joined together?
do you guys know what I'm talking about?
were they more arranged parallel or were they arranged crisscross? ?
do you think the chains are arranged parallel to one another or do you think they're crisscrossed? ?
scrunched together kinda like? ?
you kind of gave it to me, but kind of rephrase that.
are you talking about this thing right there? 
that's force, as in newtons. 
don't kill each other. 
go away, jeffrey.
what do you need, miguel?
did you go find audrey's stuff yet? 
are you planning on doing some rude symbol while my back is turned?
uh, you can actually draw a line through jack's name on there and, uh [//] was that it for this class that transferred to the high school? 
audrey, what are you doing going into other people's classrooms? 
what are you doing?
ladies? 
are you guys about finished or are you just goofing off? 
they just copied it all off of you instead of actually doing it?
miguel, sit down. 
audrey, put them away.
audrey, sit down.
cindy, could you go sit in your actual seat? 
cindy, can you wash that off your hand, please. 
pass that one back to matt, would you?
audrey, put that away or I'm gonna read it out loud to everybody. 
stop. 
stop.
gather your stuff.
let's go, folks. 
come on, you guys.

come on, you guys.
come on, Ian. 
carly, watch your mouth, please. 
matt, find your seat. 
can you do that for me, please.
I need your attention up here, please.
folks, I need your attention up here, please.
I'm glad you guys are having so much fun coloring inside the letters, but if I could get your attention up here, I would really appreciate it. 
come here. 
you need to sit down.
you need to write down tonight's homework assignment. 
I hate when you guys do that.
cindy, once it's washed off, you can sit down. 
every single day I would like you to act like perfect kids.
if today is the best you can do for being perfect, i'll take it. 
you're standing there with the door wide open. 
hey, folks. 
oh, that's so helpful.
okay, folks.
that's enough, Miguel. 
you guys remember the polymer, the newspaper polymer, do you guys remember that? ?
do you guys remember that? ?
poly means many. 
you can use this for a test.
they're gigantic molecules. 
mono means one. 
mono [//] okay, polymers are molecules joined together. 
they're around one another and they're linked together. 
thank you, a chain.
okay, we can write: mer@k. 
I was trying to kinda remember, remember “molecule” okay? ?
kinda like crisscrossed. 
you could rip it very, very easily. 
get what? 
yes? 
okay? 
fifty to sixty four is ten? 
so it would have been fourteen centimeters, right?
but you're gonna find that for most of the pull setups it's not the same, okay? 
yeah. 
that's the plan.
okay. 
there you go.
cool. 
okay. 
okay, that's cool. 
I see. 
I see. 
yeah. 
that's it.
that's it.
yeah. 
okay, thanks. 
uh, yes. 
yes, thank you.
there we go.
okay. 
okay. 
okay. 
okay. 
that would be fine. 
that [//] that's fine.
there it is right there. 
and you're all set. 
sure. 
okay. 
okay. 
that's it. 
so there you go.
okay. 
that's great. 
okay. 
that would be fine.
okay. 
all right. 
yep. 
yeah. 
yep. 
all right.
okay. 
yep. 
that's fine.
yeah, that's effort distance.
okay. 
yeah. 
that's it.
that's cool.
yes, ma'am. 
what is a monomer?
so mono means what?
what are they linked together in, samantha?
and then how's the other one?
that's your monomeer, you take a whole bunch of monomers together and what have you created? ?
does anybody here know what tetra means?
anybody here know what “tetra” means? ?
but give me kind of a definition of a monomer
which one is number one, justin? 
which one of those is number one?
well, the little ones are what? 
that's effort force.
not duct tape, plumber's tape.
and what's so important about mono?
they were parallel and because they were arranged parallel what could you what could you do to the newspaper? ?
and how were the molecules arranged in the tyvek?
they're crisscross, and what did the crisscross molecules do to the tyvek? ?
and how that kinda helps us determine what is ac [//] actually gonna happen to the polymer; how is the polymer gonna behave? ?
what about over here on this side of the room? ?
why? 
what did you leave it up there for?
so what's the difference between fifty seven and forty one? 
so they come in two kinds, manmade and natural. 
okay, tetra is a number.
usually what happens up in here is that they'll actually tell you how many of those, uh, molecules are actually bonded together. 
and, that's what I use it for, to fix gas leaks and also it's really, really good for uh, water pipes and threading things like that, too.
so it's how far you exert the force.
it's the distance over which you apply the effort.
that's what effort distance is. 
so if you start here and extend it that far, that's the effort distance. 
how far we pull this to lift the weight ten centimeters is our effort distance. 
you tie a loop in the string and pull down when you're lifting the weight up. 
so when that's being lifted ten centimeters, you want to know how far you had to pull this down.
has anybody here ever fooled around with plumber's tape before? ?
jim, share your experiences with plumber's tape.
did that tell me anything about how the chains were?
someone in here raise your hand and tell me what you think this tells you about how the polymer chains are arranged. ?
what does this tell you? ?
then how come there's not a series of marks? 
i don't think so. 
no, you didn't. 
that's not how it works. 
no. 
now, do you see the tape? ?
does anybody want to take a look at the plumber's tape? ?
and tell me what happens. ?
touch it and you can actually see how flimsy this is, too.
see, it kinda makes a cute little ribbon. 
see these white spots here?
did you find [//] you didn't get one moving west.
somebody else?
do you remember?
okay, ladies and gents somebody in here raise your hand and tell me something that you've learned about polymers. ?
something that you know about polymers, based on last class period. ?
something that you know about polymers.
so, um, you learned about manmade versus natural polymers?
anybody else?
anything else you want to add to this?
do you remember?
can somebody here tell me how were the chains arranged in the newspaper?
how were the chains arranged?
okay, what was the other thing that we used in class?
you guys remember that when we kinda drew this picture of nylon last class period?
what [//] how did that newspaper behave? ?
how did the newspaper behave as far as tearing is concerned? ?
did you learn anything about how the chains were aligned in the tape? ?
because we had a minimum day that day so we took notes, and played around with two polymers. 
but with the ones that we talked about were in chains, okay? ?
samantha mentioned that the polymers can kind of in chains [//] can kinda be arranged two different ways. 
she said, “side to side” and we'll call that “parallel” today. 
we know the polymer chains can be arranged two different ways.
they can be arranged parallel to one another, or they can be arranged crisscross. 
that's what we used this morning for threading, water pipes and stuff like that. ?
just like gave you stuff, remember? 
like candy bars and sodas, remember? 
what is it for every experiment that we're doing? 
the resistance force is just how much the resistance weighs, and as you guys just said a second ago, we are measuring it in what? 
like we learned how to do on monday. 
I remember somebody paid like three thousand dollars for a cup of soup or something like that, remember, in the secret bags. 
remember the ones we rolled up and stapled shut. 
we went over this yesterday. 
we went over [//] we went over resistance distance.
the forces [//] I went over those yesterday. 
in other words, daphne, if I were to ask you what is a monomer, what would you tell me? ?
I mean if you have to describe what they look like when they were joined together what would you tell me? ?
but what's the resistance distance?
what are the little ones?
I have no idea what you are talking about. 
but if you want to take a whole bunch of monomers and link them together what have you kind of created? ?
but if I were to pull like this I would have my name &nice nice and original again; normal again. 
how far would that be?
how far would that be?
audrey, let's say you started there, and by the time that thing was ten centimeters off the ground you were here. How far did it move?
I started at fifty, I went down to forty four. how far did it move?
started at fifty, and I went to sixty four. how far did it go?
say, you started at fifty five, and you pulled the string down to sixty on the ruler. 
say, you started at fifty five, and it went to forty five.
if you pull straight down, you'll get much more accurate measurements.
if you do it off to the side, it just, uh [//] it's not gonna be as accurate, and again estimate to the closest quarter. 
it's just you have to pull a lot more string through if you put the [//] better bring the string through first.
you're getting it. 
well, you're really close.
don't worry about that yet. 
and I'm gonna see whether or not you guys can remember that. 
and we're gonna take this one step further today in class. 
we're gonna talk about parallel and cross linked chains and what actually does that do to the polymer. 
kind of a r [//] kind of a review from what we did last class period, but also to let you know where we're going with the lesson today. 
okay, this is what we're gonna concentrate on in class today.
and you're going to investigate a polymer on your own, with your group. 
actually, it just does it by, whe [//] eh, you're gonna figure that out. 
the job is now to figure out how the polymer chains are arranged. 
so we're gonna have to do a couple of things to it to try to figure out how the polymer chains are inside the teflon or inside the plumber's tape. ?
okay, and this, ladies and gents, is what we're gonna focus on today, okay? ?
so you put all of these together and you'll get them all in a nice big old polymer chain and you create plumber's tape. 
the only thing that I'd like for you to do with the plumber's tape when you get it, is just to kinda leave it on your desk. 
I'd just like to go out and get the sunspots real quick.
then I'm gonna pass out a piece of paper to you.
and i'll pass out compasses so that we can get the sun's shape drawn before we head outside. 
and it'll probably be about one thirty or twelve thirty when we have them set up out there. 
we'll all go back in in about a minute or so.
we're gonna get started on the lab today.
you'll be using both of them at the same time. 
one person is gonna be measuring resistance distance; one person is gonna be measuring effort distance. 
so you'll have one person using the centimeter side of the ruler. 
they're gonna be measuring how high the bottom of the weight goes up.
is gonna be measuring how far they have moved the string to raise the weight ten centimeters. 
a couple things to be aware of when you're doing your measurements. 
so you want to make sure that you're pulling straight down in the direction that you are measuring. 
secondly, you want to make sure that, uh, when you're measuring the force you're also pulling straight down. 
straight down really helps on this lab. 
and you're gonna pull, and it works again much better if you pull upside down. 
you're not gonna get them all done today. 
you might not even get the first one done today.
it's better that you get accurate data than that you just rush through all of these. 
we're gonna spend a number of days on this. 
at this time I'm gonna divide you up into ten groups and send you to a station.
get started on [//] well, you can do any of the pulley setups you want. 
it doesn't matter whether you start with the first one or not, but let me sort of divide you guys up here. 
um, diane, you guys are gonna be here on the other side of this first station.
cassandra, you guys will be on this side of the first station. 
carly, you guys will be across from matt's group. 
audrey, you guys will be at this third station over here.
you guys will be just across from that. 
sheila and eleanor, you guys will be where cindy is, working at that station. 
and, josh and muriel, you'll be just across from that. 
and [//] let's see [//] andrew and zeb, you guys will be at this station back here, and you guys will be at the very last station on the end. 
we're gonna do that together once we got our data.
yes, I think that would be a wise idea. 
if I were you I'd kinda go over your notes a little bit, too. 
okay, well then you need to go and get the notes from somebody in class, okay? ?
to try to get as much information as you can about polymers because what can you do with this sheet of paper, that i'll let you do? ?
so what I'd like for you to do, is that you have the tape like this, lengthwise on your desk [//] everybody, jason, got it?
and if you would do me a favor and put your notebook on the floor, so the only thing that should be on your desk is a piece of notebook paper. ?
don't do anything to it other than just leave it on your desk. ?
then don't, don't do that, then if it's ripping through, cause it's not a good thing. ?
don't stretch it out to the point where you're gonna tear it, but go along your tape and ever so gently stretch it out. ?
now what I want you to do, is take one end and take the other end and I want you ever so gently to stretch it that way. ?
okay, do I have any others of these pages? 
did we get them tracked west?
so you guys haven't done yours yet?
where's yours? 
are we gonna mark our sunspots and track them west?
where did you start? 
where did you end?
depending on how you turned, how far would that be? 
is there anything over fifty? 
how did you get effort distance on there, zeb? 
which one? 
you're supposed to actually measure some stuff along the way, and what would that be? 
what's that? 
and how far are you supposed to lift it? 
how far did it move? 
which part are you guys stuck on here?
can I have any others?
write down tonight's homework assignment. 
on page one forty nine, I'd like you to do questions one through four, please. 
and as always write out the questions and the answers.
take two, pass it back. 
take two, and pass the rest back. 
set the compass at four and a half centimeters, please. 
separate them in two halves, take about an inch off the bottom, please. 
draw your sun circle about in the center. 
fold it in half, turn. 
please do both circles because I don't want to have to do this again tomorrow.
let's get them separated, get the covers off, and find a space in the sun.
okay, put circles on both data pieces, today and tomorrow. 
put sunspots at the top, name, date, and the period, and the time of twelve thirty, which is about when we will be out there. 
tops off.
let's get the stands from the telescopes and head on out.
bring them outside.
find a spot in the sun.
mark your sunspots and track one moving west, please. 
please be careful with them. 
please mark your sunspots and track one of them moving west. 
you need to track one of them moving west. 
you got to mark them, and that way will show you the direction west.
you got to mark not only your sunspots.
you also have to track them moving west so you know which way your image is oriented so please track one of your sunspots moving west. 
let's get your telescopes and bring them back in. 
put them together, get the covers on, bring them back up to my desk. 
let's get them back together, cases on. 
bring them up front.
justin, would you collect all the compasses? 
please send the compasses to the front of the room so justin can pick those up. 
I need you guys to take out the lab sheet that we went over yesterday, please. 
folks, get your labs.
find your spots, please.
just quickly go over this for the first setup again. 
don't use the inches; use the centimeters. 
pull straight down. 
let's head to our stations.
take your data table.
let's get them set up and get to work.
go ahead and put fifty on there. 
you're gonna want to get those out. 
you probably want to put the loop through. 
you got to measure [/] measure it while you do it, audrey. 
tie a knot in the string. 
pull it with the scale. 
read the reading in newtons.
pass everything back.
weigh this thing.
lastly, lift this ten centimeters off the ground by pulling here.
any of these areas in the full sun is fine as long as you're not behind tree shadows.
it needs [//] monica, it needs a little adjustment just so it'll get it more centered. 
so can you tilt it left and right so that the shadow goes away
okay, now you got shadow on this side, okay? 
now you just need to tilt it a little bit to make [//] there you go.
now, you should be able to see spots here. 
if you line those up in the center of the target, you should have your sun.
all I need is in the center of the target, see.
now you need to mark them. 
the direction that the sunspots move. 
when you put it on there, you're supposed to let the sun move and make a mark for one of your sunspots as it moves. 
you're just gathering three pieces of data from each pulley setup. 
you're gathering the effort distance, the effort force and the resistance force. 
when you lift the weight by ten centimeters. 
the resistance distance in every case is ten centimeters. 
there are two rulers back at the station. 
when it's at ten centimeters, that's as far as you're going. 
now, some people in earlier classes were just writing down the numbers on here. 
but it has to be straight down, and you have to know where you started. 
but you got to hold it somewhere so that you can pull. 
p+o+l+y, poly, and that gives you a really, really good idea that that must be a polymer because it has p+o+l+y on it. 
so I'd start at something even. 
this is useful for your career
this relates to your interest
you will find this interesting
this is actually fun
you will find this fun
this will be on the test
there will be a quiz later on this

quiet, please.
be quiet.
please stop talking.
please pay attention.
eyes up here, please.
please focus on what we're doing.
attention!
please look at the board.
look at the board.
look at me.
listen to me.
pay attention to me.
I need you to pay attention.
I need you to listen.
and you look at all the names of the polymers, what's at the beginning of all the names of the [//] of the chemical names of the polymers? ?
yeah, they're simple molecules, so if we take the simple molecules, daphne, we put them all together inside of a chain, what have we created? ?
and they're joined together, how are they joined together?
do you guys know what I'm talking about?
were they more arranged parallel or were they arranged crisscross? ?
do you think the chains are arranged parallel to one another or do you think they're crisscrossed? ?
scrunched together kinda like? ?
you kind of gave it to me, but kind of rephrase that.
are you talking about this thing right there? 
that's force, as in newtons. 
don't kill each other. 
go away, jeffrey.
what do you need, miguel?
did you go find audrey's stuff yet? 
are you planning on doing some rude symbol while my back is turned?
uh, you can actually draw a line through jack's name on there and, uh [//] was that it for this class that transferred to the high school? 
audrey, what are you doing going into other people's classrooms? 
what are you doing?
ladies? 
are you guys about finished or are you just goofing off? 
they just copied it all off of you instead of actually doing it?
miguel, sit down. 
audrey, put them away.
audrey, sit down.
cindy, could you go sit in your actual seat? 
cindy, can you wash that off your hand, please. 
pass that one back to matt, would you?
audrey, put that away or I'm gonna read it out loud to everybody. 
stop. 
stop.
gather your stuff.
let's go, folks. 
come on, you guys. 
let's go.
come on, miguel.
just wait. 
stay away. 
come here.
come on, you guys.
come on, Ian. 
carly, watch your mouth, please. 
matt, find your seat. 
can you do that for me, please.
I need your attention up here, please.
folks, I need your attention up here, please.
I'm glad you guys are having so much fun coloring inside the letters, but if I could get your attention up here, I would really appreciate it. 
come here. 
you need to sit down.
you need to write down tonight's homework assignment. 
I hate when you guys do that.
cindy, once it's washed off, you can sit down. 
every single day I would like you to act like perfect kids.
if today is the best you can do for being perfect, i'll take it. 
you're standing there with the door wide open. 
hey, folks. 
oh, that's so helpful.
okay, folks.
that's enough, Miguel. 
you guys remember the polymer, the newspaper polymer, do you guys remember that? ?
do you guys remember that? ?
poly means many. 
you can use this for a test.
they're gigantic molecules. 
mono means one. 
mono [//] okay, polymers are molecules joined together. 
they're around one another and they're linked together. 
thank you, a chain.
okay, we can write: mer@k. 
I was trying to kinda remember, remember “molecule” okay? ?
kinda like crisscrossed. 
you could rip it very, very easily. 
get what? 
yes? 
okay? 
fifty to sixty four is ten? 
so it would have been fourteen centimeters, right?
but you're gonna find that for most of the pull setups it's not the same, okay? 
yeah. 
that's the plan.
okay. 
there you go.
cool. 
okay. 
okay, that's cool. 
I see. 
I see. 
yeah. 
that's it.
that's it.
yeah. 
okay, thanks. 
uh, yes. 
yes, thank you.
there we go.
okay. 
okay. 
okay. 
okay. 
that would be fine. 
that [//] that's fine.
there it is right there. 
and you're all set. 
sure. 
okay. 
okay. 
that's it. 
so there you go.
okay. 
that's great. 
okay. 
that would be fine.
okay. 
all right. 
yep. 
yeah. 
yep. 
all right.
okay. 
yep. 
that's fine.
yeah, that's effort distance.
okay. 
yeah. 
that's it.
that's cool.
yes, ma'am. 
what is a monomer?
so mono means what?
what are they linked together in, samantha?
and then how's the other one?
that's your monomeer, you take a whole bunch of monomers together and what have you created? ?
does anybody here know what tetra means?
anybody here know what “tetra” means? ?
but give me kind of a definition of a monomer
which one is number one, justin? 
which one of those is number one?
well, the little ones are what? 
that's effort force.
not duct tape, plumber's tape.
and what's so important about mono?
they were parallel and because they were arranged parallel what could you what could you do to the newspaper? ?
and how were the molecules arranged in the tyvek?
they're crisscross, and what did the crisscross molecules do to the tyvek? ?
and how that kinda helps us determine what is ac [//] actually gonna happen to the polymer; how is the polymer gonna behave? ?
what about over here on this side of the room? ?
why? 
what did you leave it up there for?
so what's the difference between fifty seven and forty one? 
so they come in two kinds, manmade and natural. 
okay, tetra is a number.
usually what happens up in here is that they'll actually tell you how many of those, uh, molecules are actually bonded together. 
and, that's what I use it for, to fix gas leaks and also it's really, really good for uh, water pipes and threading things like that, too.
so it's how far you exert the force.
it's the distance over which you apply the effort.
that's what effort distance is. 
so if you start here and extend it that far, that's the effort distance. 
how far we pull this to lift the weight ten centimeters is our effort distance. 
you tie a loop in the string and pull down when you're lifting the weight up. 
so when that's being lifted ten centimeters, you want to know how far you had to pull this down.
has anybody here ever fooled around with plumber's tape before? ?
jim, share your experiences with plumber's tape.
did that tell me anything about how the chains were?
someone in here raise your hand and tell me what you think this tells you about how the polymer chains are arranged. ?
what does this tell you? ?
then how come there's not a series of marks? 
i don't think so. 
no, you didn't. 
that's not how it works. 
no. 
now, do you see the tape? ?
does anybody want to take a look at the plumber's tape? ?
and tell me what happens. ?
touch it and you can actually see how flimsy this is, too.
see, it kinda makes a cute little ribbon. 
see these white spots here?
did you find [//] you didn't get one moving west.
somebody else?
do you remember?
okay, ladies and gents somebody in here raise your hand and tell me something that you've learned about polymers. ?
something that you know about polymers, based on last class period. ?
something that you know about polymers.
so, um, you learned about manmade versus natural polymers?
anybody else?
anything else you want to add to this?
do you remember?
can somebody here tell me how were the chains arranged in the newspaper?
how were the chains arranged?
okay, what was the other thing that we used in class?
you guys remember that when we kinda drew this picture of nylon last class period?
what [//] how did that newspaper behave? ?
how did the newspaper behave as far as tearing is concerned? ?
did you learn anything about how the chains were aligned in the tape? ?
because we had a minimum day that day so we took notes, and played around with two polymers. 
but with the ones that we talked about were in chains, okay? ?
samantha mentioned that the polymers can kind of in chains [//] can kinda be arranged two different ways. 
she said, “side to side” and we'll call that “parallel” today. 
we know the polymer chains can be arranged two different ways.
they can be arranged parallel to one another, or they can be arranged crisscross. 
that's what we used this morning for threading, water pipes and stuff like that. ?
just like gave you stuff, remember? 
like candy bars and sodas, remember? 
what is it for every experiment that we're doing? 
the resistance force is just how much the resistance weighs, and as you guys just said a second ago, we are measuring it in what? 
like we learned how to do on monday. 
I remember somebody paid like three thousand dollars for a cup of soup or something like that, remember, in the secret bags. 
remember the ones we rolled up and stapled shut. 
we went over this yesterday. 
we went over [//] we went over resistance distance.
the forces [//] I went over those yesterday. 
in other words, daphne, if I were to ask you what is a monomer, what would you tell me? ?
I mean if you have to describe what they look like when they were joined together what would you tell me? ?
but what's the resistance distance?
what are the little ones?
I have no idea what you are talking about. 
but if you want to take a whole bunch of monomers and link them together what have you kind of created? ?
but if I were to pull like this I would have my name &nice nice and original again; normal again. 
how far would that be?
how far would that be?
audrey, let's say you started there, and by the time that thing was ten centimeters off the ground you were here. How far did it move?
I started at fifty, I went down to forty four. how far did it move?
started at fifty, and I went to sixty four. how far did it go?
say, you started at fifty five, and you pulled the string down to sixty on the ruler. 
say, you started at fifty five, and it went to forty five.
if you pull straight down, you'll get much more accurate measurements.
if you do it off to the side, it just, uh [//] it's not gonna be as accurate, and again estimate to the closest quarter. 
it's just you have to pull a lot more string through if you put the [//] better bring the string through first.
you're getting it. 
well, you're really close.
don't worry about that yet. 
and I'm gonna see whether or not you guys can remember that. 
and we're gonna take this one step further today in class. 
we're gonna talk about parallel and cross linked chains and what actually does that do to the polymer. 
kind of a r [//] kind of a review from what we did last class period, but also to let you know where we're going with the lesson today. 
okay, this is what we're gonna concentrate on in class today.
and you're going to investigate a polymer on your own, with your group. 
actually, it just does it by, whe [//] eh, you're gonna figure that out. 
the job is now to figure out how the polymer chains are arranged. 
so we're gonna have to do a couple of things to it to try to figure out how the polymer chains are inside the teflon or inside the plumber's tape. ?
okay, and this, ladies and gents, is what we're gonna focus on today, okay? ?
so you put all of these together and you'll get them all in a nice big old polymer chain and you create plumber's tape. 
the only thing that I'd like for you to do with the plumber's tape when you get it, is just to kinda leave it on your desk. 
I'd just like to go out and get the sunspots real quick.
then I'm gonna pass out a piece of paper to you.
and i'll pass out compasses so that we can get the sun's shape drawn before we head outside. 
and it'll probably be about one thirty or twelve thirty when we have them set up out there. 
we'll all go back in in about a minute or so.
we're gonna get started on the lab today.
you'll be using both of them at the same time. 
one person is gonna be measuring resistance distance; one person is gonna be measuring effort distance. 
so you'll have one person using the centimeter side of the ruler. 
they're gonna be measuring how high the bottom of the weight goes up.
is gonna be measuring how far they have moved the string to raise the weight ten centimeters. 
a couple things to be aware of when you're doing your measurements. 
so you want to make sure that you're pulling straight down in the direction that you are measuring. 
secondly, you want to make sure that, uh, when you're measuring the force you're also pulling straight down. 
straight down really helps on this lab. 
and you're gonna pull, and it works again much better if you pull upside down. 
you're not gonna get them all done today. 
you might not even get the first one done today.
it's better that you get accurate data than that you just rush through all of these. 
we're gonna spend a number of days on this. 
at this time I'm gonna divide you up into ten groups and send you to a station.
get started on [//] well, you can do any of the pulley setups you want. 
it doesn't matter whether you start with the first one or not, but let me sort of divide you guys up here. 
um, diane, you guys are gonna be here on the other side of this first station.
cassandra, you guys will be on this side of the first station. 
carly, you guys will be across from matt's group. 
audrey, you guys will be at this third station over here.
you guys will be just across from that. 
sheila and eleanor, you guys will be where cindy is, working at that station. 
and, josh and muriel, you'll be just across from that. 
and [//] let's see [//] andrew and zeb, you guys will be at this station back here, and you guys will be at the very last station on the end. 
we're gonna do that together once we got our data.
yes, I think that would be a wise idea. 
if I were you I'd kinda go over your notes a little bit, too. 
okay, well then you need to go and get the notes from somebody in class, okay? ?
to try to get as much information as you can about polymers because what can you do with this sheet of paper, that i'll let you do? ?
so what I'd like for you to do, is that you have the tape like this, lengthwise on your desk [//] everybody, jason, got it?
and if you would do me a favor and put your notebook on the floor, so the only thing that should be on your desk is a piece of notebook paper. ?
don't do anything to it other than just leave it on your desk. ?
then don't, don't do that, then if it's ripping through, cause it's not a good thing. ?
don't stretch it out to the point where you're gonna tear it, but go along your tape and ever so gently stretch it out. ?
now what I want you to do, is take one end and take the other end and I want you ever so gently to stretch it that way. ?
okay, do I have any others of these pages? 
did we get them tracked west?
so you guys haven't done yours yet?
where's yours? 
are we gonna mark our sunspots and track them west?
where did you start? 
where did you end?
depending on how you turned, how far would that be? 
is there anything over fifty? 
how did you get effort distance on there, zeb? 
which one? 
you're supposed to actually measure some stuff along the way, and what would that be? 
what's that? 
and how far are you supposed to lift it? 
how far did it move? 
which part are you guys stuck on here?
can I have any others?
write down tonight's homework assignment. 
on page one forty nine, I'd like you to do questions one through four, please. 
and as always write out the questions and the answers.
take two, pass it back. 
take two, and pass the rest back. 
set the compass at four and a half centimeters, please. 
separate them in two halves, take about an inch off the bottom, please. 
draw your sun circle about in the center. 
fold it in half, turn. 
please do both circles because I don't want to have to do this again tomorrow.
let's get them separated, get the covers off, and find a space in the sun.
okay, put circles on both data pieces, today and tomorrow. 
put sunspots at the top, name, date, and the period, and the time of twelve thirty, which is about when we will be out there. 
tops off.
let's get the stands from the telescopes and head on out.
bring them outside.
find a spot in the sun.
mark your sunspots and track one moving west, please. 
please be careful with them. 
please mark your sunspots and track one of them moving west. 
you need to track one of them moving west. 
you got to mark them, and that way will show you the direction west.
you got to mark not only your sunspots.
you also have to track them moving west so you know which way your image is oriented so please track one of your sunspots moving west. 
let's get your telescopes and bring them back in. 
put them together, get the covers on, bring them back up to my desk. 
let's get them back together, cases on. 
bring them up front.
justin, would you collect all the compasses? 
please send the compasses to the front of the room so justin can pick those up. 
I need you guys to take out the lab sheet that we went over yesterday, please. 
folks, get your labs.
find your spots, please.
just quickly go over this for the first setup again. 
don't use the inches; use the centimeters. 
pull straight down. 
let's head to our stations.
take your data table.
let's get them set up and get to work.
go ahead and put fifty on there. 
you're gonna want to get those out. 
you probably want to put the loop through. 
you got to measure [/] measure it while you do it, audrey. 
tie a knot in the string. 
pull it with the scale. 
read the reading in newtons.
pass everything back.
weigh this thing.
lastly, lift this ten centimeters off the ground by pulling here.
any of these areas in the full sun is fine as long as you're not behind tree shadows.
it needs [//] monica, it needs a little adjustment just so it'll get it more centered. 
so can you tilt it left and right so that the shadow goes away
okay, now you got shadow on this side, okay? 
now you just need to tilt it a little bit to make [//] there you go.
now, you should be able to see spots here. 
if you line those up in the center of the target, you should have your sun.
all I need is in the center of the target, see.
now you need to mark them. 
the direction that the sunspots move. 
when you put it on there, you're supposed to let the sun move and make a mark for one of your sunspots as it moves. 
you're just gathering three pieces of data from each pulley setup. 
you're gathering the effort distance, the effort force and the resistance force. 
when you lift the weight by ten centimeters. 
the resistance distance in every case is ten centimeters. 
there are two rulers back at the station. 
when it's at ten centimeters, that's as far as you're going. 
now, some people in earlier classes were just writing down the numbers on here. 
but it has to be straight down, and you have to know where you started. 
but you got to hold it somewhere so that you can pull. 
p+o+l+y, poly, and that gives you a really, really good idea that that must be a polymer because it has p+o+l+y on it. 
so I'd start at something even. 
this is useful for your career
this relates to your interest
you will find this interesting
this is actually fun
you will find this fun
this will be on the test
there will be a quiz later on this

eyes up here, please.
please focus on what we're doing.
attention!
please look at the board.
look at the board.
look at me.
listen to me.
pay attention to me.
I need you to pay attention.
I need you to listen.
and you look at all the names of the polymers, what's at the beginning of all the names of the [//] of the chemical names of the polymers? ?
yeah, they're simple molecules, so if we take the simple molecules, daphne, we put them all together inside of a chain, what have we created? ?
and they're joined together, how are they joined together?
do you guys know what I'm talking about?
were they more arranged parallel or were they arranged crisscross? ?
do you think the chains are arranged parallel to one another or do you think they're crisscrossed? ?
scrunched together kinda like? ?
you kind of gave it to me, but kind of rephrase that.
are you talking about this thing right there? 
that's force, as in newtons. 
don't kill each other. 
go away, jeffrey.
what do you need, miguel?
did you go find audrey's stuff yet? 
are you planning on doing some rude symbol while my back is turned?
uh, you can actually draw a line through jack's name on there and, uh [//] was that it for this class that transferred to the high school? 
audrey, what are you doing going into other people's classrooms? 
what are you doing?
ladies? 
are you guys about finished or are you just goofing off? 
they just copied it all off of you instead of actually doing it?
miguel, sit down. 
audrey, put them away.
audrey, sit down.
cindy, could you go sit in your actual seat? 
cindy, can you wash that off your hand, please. 
pass that one back to matt, would you?
audrey, put that away or I'm gonna read it out loud to everybody. 
stop. 
stop.
gather your stuff.
let's go, folks. 
come on, you guys. 
let's go.
come on, miguel.
just wait. 
stay away. 
come here.
come on, you guys.
come on, Ian. 
carly, watch your mouth, please. 
matt, find your seat. 
can you do that for me, please.
I need your attention up here, please.
folks, I need your attention up here, please.
I'm glad you guys are having so much fun coloring inside the letters, but if I could get your attention up here, I would really appreciate it. 
come here. 
you need to sit down.
you need to write down tonight's homework assignment. 
I hate when you guys do that.
cindy, once it's washed off, you can sit down. 
every single day I would like you to act like perfect kids.
if today is the best you can do for being perfect, i'll take it. 
you're standing there with the door wide open. 
hey, folks. 
oh, that's so helpful.
okay, folks.
that's enough, Miguel. 
you guys remember the polymer, the newspaper polymer, do you guys remember that? ?
do you guys remember that? ?
poly means many. 
you can use this for a test.
they're gigantic molecules. 
mono means one. 
mono [//] okay, polymers are molecules joined together. 
they're around one another and they're linked together. 
thank you, a chain.
okay, we can write: mer@k. 
I was trying to kinda remember, remember “molecule” okay? ?
kinda like crisscrossed. 
you could rip it very, very easily. 
get what? 
yes? 
okay? 
fifty to sixty four is ten? 
so it would have been fourteen centimeters, right?
but you're gonna find that for most of the pull setups it's not the same, okay? 
yeah. 
that's the plan.
okay. 
there you go.
cool. 
okay. 
okay, that's cool. 
I see. 
I see. 
yeah. 
that's it.
that's it.
yeah. 
okay, thanks. 
uh, yes. 
yes, thank you.
there we go.
okay. 
okay. 
okay. 
okay. 
that would be fine. 
that [//] that's fine.
there it is right there. 
and you're all set. 
sure. 
okay. 
okay. 
that's it. 
so there you go.
okay. 
that's great. 
okay. 
that would be fine.
okay. 
all right. 
yep. 
yeah. 
yep. 
all right.
okay. 
yep. 
that's fine.
yeah, that's effort distance.
okay. 
yeah. 
that's it.
that's cool.
yes, ma'am. 
what is a monomer?
so mono means what?
what are they linked together in, samantha?
and then how's the other one?
that's your monomeer, you take a whole bunch of monomers together and what have you created? ?
does anybody here know what tetra means?
anybody here know what “tetra” means? ?
but give me kind of a definition of a monomer
which one is number one, justin? 
which one of those is number one?
well, the little ones are what? 
that's effort force.
not duct tape, plumber's tape.
and what's so important about mono?
they were parallel and because they were arranged parallel what could you what could you do to the newspaper? ?
and how were the molecules arranged in the tyvek?
they're crisscross, and what did the crisscross molecules do to the tyvek? ?
and how that kinda helps us determine what is ac [//] actually gonna happen to the polymer; how is the polymer gonna behave? ?
what about over here on this side of the room? ?
why? 
what did you leave it up there for?
so what's the difference between fifty seven and forty one? 
so they come in two kinds, manmade and natural. 
okay, tetra is a number.
usually what happens up in here is that they'll actually tell you how many of those, uh, molecules are actually bonded together. 
and, that's what I use it for, to fix gas leaks and also it's really, really good for uh, water pipes and threading things like that, too.
so it's how far you exert the force.
it's the distance over which you apply the effort.
that's what effort distance is. 
so if you start here and extend it that far, that's the effort distance. 
how far we pull this to lift the weight ten centimeters is our effort distance. 
you tie a loop in the string and pull down when you're lifting the weight up. 
so when that's being lifted ten centimeters, you want to know how far you had to pull this down.
has anybody here ever fooled around with plumber's tape before? ?
jim, share your experiences with plumber's tape.
did that tell me anything about how the chains were?
someone in here raise your hand and tell me what you think this tells you about how the polymer chains are arranged. ?
what does this tell you? ?
then how come there's not a series of marks? 
i don't think so. 
no, you didn't. 
that's not how it works. 
no. 
now, do you see the tape? ?
does anybody want to take a look at the plumber's tape? ?
and tell me what happens. ?
touch it and you can actually see how flimsy this is, too.
see, it kinda makes a cute little ribbon. 
see these white spots here?
did you find [//] you didn't get one moving west.
somebody else?
do you remember?
okay, ladies and gents somebody in here raise your hand and tell me something that you've learned about polymers. ?
something that you know about polymers, based on last class period. ?
something that you know about polymers.
so, um, you learned about manmade versus natural polymers?
anybody else?
anything else you want to add to this?
do you remember?
can somebody here tell me how were the chains arranged in the newspaper?
how were the chains arranged?
okay, what was the other thing that we used in class?
you guys remember that when we kinda drew this picture of nylon last class period?
what [//] how did that newspaper behave? ?
how did the newspaper behave as far as tearing is concerned? ?
did you learn anything about how the chains were aligned in the tape? ?
because we had a minimum day that day so we took notes, and played around with two polymers. 
but with the ones that we talked about were in chains, okay? ?
samantha mentioned that the polymers can kind of in chains [//] can kinda be arranged two different ways. 
she said, “side to side” and we'll call that “parallel” today. 
we know the polymer chains can be arranged two different ways.
they can be arranged parallel to one another, or they can be arranged crisscross. 
that's what we used this morning for threading, water pipes and stuff like that. ?
just like gave you stuff, remember? 
like candy bars and sodas, remember? 
what is it for every experiment that we're doing? 
the resistance force is just how much the resistance weighs, and as you guys just said a second ago, we are measuring it in what? 
like we learned how to do on monday. 
I remember somebody paid like three thousand dollars for a cup of soup or something like that, remember, in the secret bags. 
remember the ones we rolled up and stapled shut. 
we went over this yesterday. 
we went over [//] we went over resistance distance.
the forces [//] I went over those yesterday. 
in other words, daphne, if I were to ask you what is a monomer, what would you tell me? ?
I mean if you have to describe what they look like when they were joined together what would you tell me? ?
but what's the resistance distance?
what are the little ones?
I have no idea what you are talking about. 
but if you want to take a whole bunch of monomers and link them together what have you kind of created? ?
but if I were to pull like this I would have my name &nice nice and original again; normal again. 
how far would that be?
how far would that be?
audrey, let's say you started there, and by the time that thing was ten centimeters off the ground you were here. How far did it move?
I started at fifty, I went down to forty four. how far did it move?
started at fifty, and I went to sixty four. how far did it go?
say, you started at fifty five, and you pulled the string down to sixty on the ruler. 
say, you started at fifty five, and it went to forty five.
if you pull straight down, you'll get much more accurate measurements.
if you do it off to the side, it just, uh [//] it's not gonna be as accurate, and again estimate to the closest quarter. 
it's just you have to pull a lot more string through if you put the [//] better bring the string through first.
you're getting it. 
well, you're really close.
don't worry about that yet. 
and I'm gonna see whether or not you guys can remember that. 
and we're gonna take this one step further today in class. 
we're gonna talk about parallel and cross linked chains and what actually does that do to the polymer. 
kind of a r [//] kind of a review from what we did last class period, but also to let you know where we're going with the lesson today. 
okay, this is what we're gonna concentrate on in class today.
and you're going to investigate a polymer on your own, with your group. 
actually, it just does it by, whe [//] eh, you're gonna figure that out. 
the job is now to figure out how the polymer chains are arranged. 
so we're gonna have to do a couple of things to it to try to figure out how the polymer chains are inside the teflon or inside the plumber's tape. ?
okay, and this, ladies and gents, is what we're gonna focus on today, okay? ?
so you put all of these together and you'll get them all in a nice big old polymer chain and you create plumber's tape. 
the only thing that I'd like for you to do with the plumber's tape when you get it, is just to kinda leave it on your desk. 
I'd just like to go out and get the sunspots real quick.
then I'm gonna pass out a piece of paper to you.
and i'll pass out compasses so that we can get the sun's shape drawn before we head outside. 
and it'll probably be about one thirty or twelve thirty when we have them set up out there. 
we'll all go back in in about a minute or so.
we're gonna get started on the lab today.
you'll be using both of them at the same time. 
one person is gonna be measuring resistance distance; one person is gonna be measuring effort distance. 
so you'll have one person using the centimeter side of the ruler. 
they're gonna be measuring how high the bottom of the weight goes up.
is gonna be measuring how far they have moved the string to raise the weight ten centimeters. 
a couple things to be aware of when you're doing your measurements. 
so you want to make sure that you're pulling straight down in the direction that you are measuring. 
secondly, you want to make sure that, uh, when you're measuring the force you're also pulling straight down. 
straight down really helps on this lab. 
and you're gonna pull, and it works again much better if you pull upside down. 
you're not gonna get them all done today. 
you might not even get the first one done today.
it's better that you get accurate data than that you just rush through all of these. 
we're gonna spend a number of days on this. 
at this time I'm gonna divide you up into ten groups and send you to a station.
get started on [//] well, you can do any of the pulley setups you want. 
it doesn't matter whether you start with the first one or not, but let me sort of divide you guys up here. 
um, diane, you guys are gonna be here on the other side of this first station.
cassandra, you guys will be on this side of the first station. 
carly, you guys will be across from matt's group. 
audrey, you guys will be at this third station over here.
you guys will be just across from that. 
sheila and eleanor, you guys will be where cindy is, working at that station. 
and, josh and muriel, you'll be just across from that. 
and [//] let's see [//] andrew and zeb, you guys will be at this station back here, and you guys will be at the very last station on the end. 
we're gonna do that together once we got our data.
yes, I think that would be a wise idea. 
if I were you I'd kinda go over your notes a little bit, too. 
okay, well then you need to go and get the notes from somebody in class, okay? ?
to try to get as much information as you can about polymers because what can you do with this sheet of paper, that i'll let you do? ?
so what I'd like for you to do, is that you have the tape like this, lengthwise on your desk [//] everybody, jason, got it?
and if you would do me a favor and put your notebook on the floor, so the only thing that should be on your desk is a piece of notebook paper. ?
don't do anything to it other than just leave it on your desk. ?
then don't, don't do that, then if it's ripping through, cause it's not a good thing. ?
don't stretch it out to the point where you're gonna tear it, but go along your tape and ever so gently stretch it out. ?
now what I want you to do, is take one end and take the other end and I want you ever so gently to stretch it that way. ?
okay, do I have any others of these pages? 
did we get them tracked west?
so you guys haven't done yours yet?
where's yours? 
are we gonna mark our sunspots and track them west?
where did you start? 
where did you end?
depending on how you turned, how far would that be? 
is there anything over fifty? 
how did you get effort distance on there, zeb? 
which one? 
you're supposed to actually measure some stuff along the way, and what would that be? 
what's that? 
and how far are you supposed to lift it? 
how far did it move? 
which part are you guys stuck on here?
can I have any others?
write down tonight's homework assignment. 
on page one forty nine, I'd like you to do questions one through four, please. 
and as always write out the questions and the answers.
take two, pass it back. 
take two, and pass the rest back. 
set the compass at four and a half centimeters, please. 
separate them in two halves, take about an inch off the bottom, please. 
draw your sun circle about in the center. 
fold it in half, turn. 
please do both circles because I don't want to have to do this again tomorrow.
let's get them separated, get the covers off, and find a space in the sun.
okay, put circles on both data pieces, today and tomorrow. 
put sunspots at the top, name, date, and the period, and the time of twelve thirty, which is about when we will be out there. 
tops off.
let's get the stands from the telescopes and head on out.
bring them outside.
find a spot in the sun.
mark your sunspots and track one moving west, please. 
please be careful with them. 
please mark your sunspots and track one of them moving west. 
you need to track one of them moving west. 
you got to mark them, and that way will show you the direction west.
you got to mark not only your sunspots.
you also have to track them moving west so you know which way your image is oriented so please track one of your sunspots moving west. 
let's get your telescopes and bring them back in. 
put them together, get the covers on, bring them back up to my desk. 
let's get them back together, cases on. 
bring them up front.
justin, would you collect all the compasses? 
please send the compasses to the front of the room so justin can pick those up. 
I need you guys to take out the lab sheet that we went over yesterday, please. 
folks, get your labs.
find your spots, please.
just quickly go over this for the first setup again. 
don't use the inches; use the centimeters. 
pull straight down. 
let's head to our stations.
take your data table.
let's get them set up and get to work.
go ahead and put fifty on there. 
you're gonna want to get those out. 
you probably want to put the loop through. 
you got to measure [/] measure it while you do it, audrey. 
tie a knot in the string. 
pull it with the scale. 
read the reading in newtons.
pass everything back.
weigh this thing.
lastly, lift this ten centimeters off the ground by pulling here.
any of these areas in the full sun is fine as long as you're not behind tree shadows.
it needs [//] monica, it needs a little adjustment just so it'll get it more centered. 
so can you tilt it left and right so that the shadow goes away
okay, now you got shadow on this side, okay? 
now you just need to tilt it a little bit to make [//] there you go.
now, you should be able to see spots here. 
if you line those up in the center of the target, you should have your sun.
all I need is in the center of the target, see.
now you need to mark them. 
the direction that the sunspots move. 
when you put it on there, you're supposed to let the sun move and make a mark for one of your sunspots as it moves. 
you're just gathering three pieces of data from each pulley setup. 
you're gathering the effort distance, the effort force and the resistance force. 
when you lift the weight by ten centimeters. 
the resistance distance in every case is ten centimeters. 
there are two rulers back at the station. 
when it's at ten centimeters, that's as far as you're going. 
now, some people in earlier classes were just writing down the numbers on here. 
but it has to be straight down, and you have to know where you started. 
but you got to hold it somewhere so that you can pull. 
p+o+l+y, poly, and that gives you a really, really good idea that that must be a polymer because it has p+o+l+y on it. 
so I'd start at something even. 
this is useful for your career
this relates to your interest
you will find this interesting
this is actually fun
you will find this fun
this will be on the test
there will be a quiz later on this
you need to know this for the test

quiet, please.
be quiet.
please stop talking.
please pay attention.
eyes up here, please.
please focus on what we're doing.
attention!
please look at the board.
look at the board.
look at me.
listen to me.
pay attention to me.
I need you to pay attention.
I need you to listen.
and you look at all the names of the polymers, what's at the beginning of all the names of the [//] of the chemical names of the polymers? ?
yeah, they're simple molecules, so if we take the simple molecules, daphne, we put them all together inside of a chain, what have we created? ?
and they're joined together, how are they joined together?
do you guys know what I'm talking about?
were they more arranged parallel or were they arranged crisscross? ?
do you think the chains are arranged parallel to one another or do you think they're crisscrossed? ?
scrunched together kinda like? ?
you kind of gave it to me, but kind of rephrase that.
are you talking about this thing right there? 
that's force, as in newtons. 
don't kill each other. 
go away, jeffrey.
what do you need, miguel?
did you go find audrey's stuff yet? 
are you planning on doing some rude symbol while my back is turned?
uh, you can actually draw a line through jack's name on there and, uh [//] was that it for this class that transferred to the high school? 
audrey, what are you doing going into other people's classrooms? 
what are you doing?
ladies? 
are you guys about finished or are you just goofing off? 
they just copied it all off of you instead of actually doing it?
miguel, sit down. 
audrey, put them away.
audrey, sit down.
cindy, could you go sit in your actual seat? 
cindy, can you wash that off your hand, please. 
pass that one back to matt, would you?
audrey, put that away or I'm gonna read it out loud to everybody. 
stop. 
stop.
gather your stuff.
let's go, folks. 
come on, you guys. 
let's go.
come on, miguel.
just wait. 
stay away. 
come here.
come on, you guys.
come on, Ian. 
carly, watch your mouth, please. 
matt, find your seat. 
can you do that for me, please.
I need your attention up here, please.
folks, I need your attention up here, please.
I'm glad you guys are having so much fun coloring inside the letters, but if I could get your attention up here, I would really appreciate it. 
come here. 
you need to sit down.
you need to write down tonight's homework assignment. 
I hate when you guys do that.
cindy, once it's washed off, you can sit down. 
every single day I would like you to act like perfect kids.
if today is the best you can do for being perfect, i'll take it. 
you're standing there with the door wide open. 
hey, folks. 
oh, that's so helpful.
okay, folks.
that's enough, Miguel. 
you guys remember the polymer, the newspaper polymer, do you guys remember that? ?
do you guys remember that? ?
poly means many. 
you can use this for a test.
they're gigantic molecules. 
mono means one. 
mono [//] okay, polymers are molecules joined together. 
they're around one another and they're linked together. 
thank you, a chain.
okay, we can write: mer@k. 
I was trying to kinda remember, remember “molecule” okay? ?
kinda like crisscrossed. 
you could rip it very, very easily. 
get what? 
yes? 
okay? 
fifty to sixty four is ten? 
so it would have been fourteen centimeters, right?
but you're gonna find that for most of the pull setups it's not the same, okay? 
yeah. 
that's the plan.
okay. 
there you go.
cool. 
okay. 
okay, that's cool. 
I see. 
I see. 
yeah. 
that's it.
that's it.
yeah. 
okay, thanks. 
uh, yes. 
yes, thank you.
there we go.
okay. 
okay. 
okay. 
okay. 
that would be fine. 
that [//] that's fine.
there it is right there. 
and you're all set. 
sure. 
okay. 
okay. 
that's it. 
so there you go.
okay. 
that's great. 
okay. 
that would be fine.
okay. 
all right. 
yep. 
yeah. 
yep. 
all right.
okay. 
yep. 
that's fine.
yeah, that's effort distance.
okay. 
yeah. 
that's it.
that's cool.
yes, ma'am. 
what is a monomer?
so mono means what?
what are they linked together in, samantha?
and then how's the other one?
that's your monomeer, you take a whole bunch of monomers together and what have you created? ?
does anybody here know what tetra means?
anybody here know what “tetra” means? ?
but give me kind of a definition of a monomer
which one is number one, justin? 
which one of those is number one?
well, the little ones are what? 
that's effort force.
not duct tape, plumber's tape.
and what's so important about mono?
they were parallel and because they were arranged parallel what could you what could you do to the newspaper? ?
and how were the molecules arranged in the tyvek?
they're crisscross, and what did the crisscross molecules do to the tyvek? ?
and how that kinda helps us determine what is ac [//] actually gonna happen to the polymer; how is the polymer gonna behave? ?
what about over here on this side of the room? ?
why? 
what did you leave it up there for?
so what's the difference between fifty seven and forty one? 
so they come in two kinds, manmade and natural. 
okay, tetra is a number.
usually what happens up in here is that they'll actually tell you how many of those, uh, molecules are actually bonded together. 
and, that's what I use it for, to fix gas leaks and also it's really, really good for uh, water pipes and threading things like that, too.
so it's how far you exert the force.
it's the distance over which you apply the effort.
that's what effort distance is. 
so if you start here and extend it that far, that's the effort distance. 
how far we pull this to lift the weight ten centimeters is our effort distance. 
you tie a loop in the string and pull down when you're lifting the weight up. 
so when that's being lifted ten centimeters, you want to know how far you had to pull this down.
has anybody here ever fooled around with plumber's tape before? ?
jim, share your experiences with plumber's tape.
did that tell me anything about how the chains were?
someone in here raise your hand and tell me what you think this tells you about how the polymer chains are arranged. ?
what does this tell you? ?
then how come there's not a series of marks? 
i don't think so. 
no, you didn't. 
that's not how it works. 
no. 
now, do you see the tape? ?
does anybody want to take a look at the plumber's tape? ?
and tell me what happens. ?
touch it and you can actually see how flimsy this is, too.
see, it kinda makes a cute little ribbon. 
see these white spots here?
did you find [//] you didn't get one moving west.
somebody else?
do you remember?
okay, ladies and gents somebody in here raise your hand and tell me something that you've learned about polymers. ?
something that you know about polymers, based on last class period. ?
something that you know about polymers.
so, um, you learned about manmade versus natural polymers?
anybody else?
anything else you want to add to this?
do you remember?
can somebody here tell me how were the chains arranged in the newspaper?
how were the chains arranged?
okay, what was the other thing that we used in class?
you guys remember that when we kinda drew this picture of nylon last class period?
what [//] how did that newspaper behave? ?
how did the newspaper behave as far as tearing is concerned? ?
did you learn anything about how the chains were aligned in the tape? ?
because we had a minimum day that day so we took notes, and played around with two polymers. 
but with the ones that we talked about were in chains, okay? ?
samantha mentioned that the polymers can kind of in chains [//] can kinda be arranged two different ways. 
she said, “side to side” and we'll call that “parallel” today. 
we know the polymer chains can be arranged two different ways.
they can be arranged parallel to one another, or they can be arranged crisscross. 
that's what we used this morning for threading, water pipes and stuff like that. ?
just like gave you stuff, remember? 
like candy bars and sodas, remember? 
what is it for every experiment that we're doing? 
the resistance force is just how much the resistance weighs, and as you guys just said a second ago, we are measuring it in what? 
like we learned how to do on monday. 
I remember somebody paid like three thousand dollars for a cup of soup or something like that, remember, in the secret bags. 
remember the ones we rolled up and stapled shut. 
we went over this yesterday. 
we went over [//] we went over resistance distance.
the forces [//] I went over those yesterday. 
in other words, daphne, if I were to ask you what is a monomer, what would you tell me? ?
I mean if you have to describe what they look like when they were joined together what would you tell me? ?
but what's the resistance distance?
what are the little ones?
I have no idea what you are talking about. 
but if you want to take a whole bunch of monomers and link them together what have you kind of created? ?
but if I were to pull like this I would have my name &nice nice and original again; normal again. 
how far would that be?
how far would that be?
audrey, let's say you started there, and by the time that thing was ten centimeters off the ground you were here. How far did it move?
I started at fifty, I went down to forty four. how far did it move?
started at fifty, and I went to sixty four. how far did it go?
say, you started at fifty five, and you pulled the string down to sixty on the ruler. 
say, you started at fifty five, and it went to forty five.
if you pull straight down, you'll get much more accurate measurements.
if you do it off to the side, it just, uh [//] it's not gonna be as accurate, and again estimate to the closest quarter. 
it's just you have to pull a lot more string through if you put the [//] better bring the string through first.
you're getting it. 
well, you're really close.
don't worry about that yet. 
and I'm gonna see whether or not you guys can remember that. 
and we're gonna take this one step further today in class. 
we're gonna talk about parallel and cross linked chains and what actually does that do to the polymer. 
kind of a r [//] kind of a review from what we did last class period, but also to let you know where we're going with the lesson today. 
okay, this is what we're gonna concentrate on in class today.
and you're going to investigate a polymer on your own, with your group. 
actually, it just does it by, whe [//] eh, you're gonna figure that out. 
the job is now to figure out how the polymer chains are arranged. 
so we're gonna have to do a couple of things to it to try to figure out how the polymer chains are inside the teflon or inside the plumber's tape. ?
okay, and this, ladies and gents, is what we're gonna focus on today, okay? ?
so you put all of these together and you'll get them all in a nice big old polymer chain and you create plumber's tape. 
the only thing that I'd like for you to do with the plumber's tape when you get it, is just to kinda leave it on your desk. 
I'd just like to go out and get the sunspots real quick.
then I'm gonna pass out a piece of paper to you.
and i'll pass out compasses so that we can get the sun's shape drawn before we head outside. 
and it'll probably be about one thirty or twelve thirty when we have them set up out there. 
we'll all go back in in about a minute or so.
we're gonna get started on the lab today.
you'll be using both of them at the same time. 
one person is gonna be measuring resistance distance; one person is gonna be measuring effort distance. 
so you'll have one person using the centimeter side of the ruler. 
they're gonna be measuring how high the bottom of the weight goes up.
is gonna be measuring how far they have moved the string to raise the weight ten centimeters. 
a couple things to be aware of when you're doing your measurements. 
so you want to make sure that you're pulling straight down in the direction that you are measuring. 
secondly, you want to make sure that, uh, when you're measuring the force you're also pulling straight down. 
straight down really helps on this lab. 
and you're gonna pull, and it works again much better if you pull upside down. 
you're not gonna get them all done today. 
you might not even get the first one done today.
it's better that you get accurate data than that you just rush through all of these. 
we're gonna spend a number of days on this. 
at this time I'm gonna divide you up into ten groups and send you to a station.
get started on [//] well, you can do any of the pulley setups you want. 
it doesn't matter whether you start with the first one or not, but let me sort of divide you guys up here. 
um, diane, you guys are gonna be here on the other side of this first station.
cassandra, you guys will be on this side of the first station. 
carly, you guys will be across from matt's group. 
audrey, you guys will be at this third station over here.
you guys will be just across from that. 
sheila and eleanor, you guys will be where cindy is, working at that station. 
and, josh and muriel, you'll be just across from that. 
and [//] let's see [//] andrew and zeb, you guys will be at this station back here, and you guys will be at the very last station on the end. 
we're gonna do that together once we got our data.
yes, I think that would be a wise idea. 
if I were you I'd kinda go over your notes a little bit, too. 
okay, well then you need to go and get the notes from somebody in class, okay? ?
to try to get as much information as you can about polymers because what can you do with this sheet of paper, that i'll let you do? ?
so what I'd like for you to do, is that you have the tape like this, lengthwise on your desk [//] everybody, jason, got it?
and if you would do me a favor and put your notebook on the floor, so the only thing that should be on your desk is a piece of notebook paper. ?
don't do anything to it other than just leave it on your desk. ?
then don't, don't do that, then if it's ripping through, cause it's not a good thing. ?
don't stretch it out to the point where you're gonna tear it, but go along your tape and ever so gently stretch it out. ?
now what I want you to do, is take one end and take the other end and I want you ever so gently to stretch it that way. ?
okay, do I have any others of these pages? 
did we get them tracked west?
so you guys haven't done yours yet?
where's yours? 
are we gonna mark our sunspots and track them west?
where did you start? 
where did you end?
depending on how you turned, how far would that be? 
is there anything over fifty? 
how did you get effort distance on there, zeb? 
which one? 
you're supposed to actually measure some stuff along the way, and what would that be? 
what's that? 
and how far are you supposed to lift it? 
how far did it move? 
which part are you guys stuck on here?
can I have any others?
write down tonight's homework assignment. 
on page one forty nine, I'd like you to do questions one through four, please. 
and as always write out the questions and the answers.

let's get them back together, cases on. 
bring them up front.
justin, would you collect all the compasses? 
please send the compasses to the front of the room so justin can pick those up. 
I need you guys to take out the lab sheet that we went over yesterday, please. 
folks, get your labs.
find your spots, please.
just quickly go over this for the first setup again. 
don't use the inches; use the centimeters. 
pull straight down. 
let's head to our stations.
take your data table.
let's get them set up and get to work.
go ahead and put fifty on there. 
you're gonna want to get those out. 
you probably want to put the loop through. 
you got to measure [/] measure it while you do it, audrey. 
tie a knot in the string.

any of these areas in the full sun is fine as long as you're not behind tree shadows.
it needs [//] monica, it needs a little adjustment just so it'll get it more centered.

if you line those up in the center of the target, you should have your sun.
all I need is in the center of the target, see.
now you need to mark them. 
the direction that the sunspots move. 
when you put it on there, you're supposed to let the sun move and make a mark for one of your sunspots as it moves. 
you're just gathering three pieces of data from each pulley setup. 
you're gathering the effort distance, the effort force and the resistance force. 
when you lift the weight by ten centimeters. 
the resistance distance in every case is ten centimeters. 
there are two rulers back at the station. 
when it's at ten centimeters, that's as far as you're going. 
now, some people in earlier classes were just writing down the numbers on here. 
but it has to be straight down, and you have to know where you started. 
but you got to hold it somewhere so that you can pull. 
p+o+l+y, poly, and that gives you a really, really good idea that that must be a polymer because it has p+o+l+y on it. 
so I'd start at something even.

please stop talking.
please pay attention.
eyes up here, please.
please focus on what we're doing.
attention!
please look at the board.
look at the board.
look at me.
listen to me.
pay attention to me.
I need you to pay attention.
I need you to listen.
and you look at all the names of the polymers, what's at the beginning of all the names of the [//] of the chemical names of the polymers? ?
yeah, they're simple molecules, so if we take the simple molecules, daphne, we put them all together inside of a chain, what have we created? ?
and they're joined together, how are they joined together?
do you guys know what I'm talking about?
were they more arranged parallel or were they arranged crisscross? ?
do you think the chains are arranged parallel to one another or do you think they're crisscrossed? ?
scrunched together kinda like? ?
you kind of gave it to me, but kind of rephrase that.
are you talking about this thing right there? 
that's force, as in newtons. 
don't kill each other. 
go away, jeffrey.
what do you need, miguel?
did you go find audrey's stuff yet? 
are you planning on doing some rude symbol while my back is turned?
uh, you can actually draw a line through jack's name on there and, uh [//] was that it for this class that transferred to the high school? 
audrey, what are you doing going into other people's classrooms? 
what are you doing?
ladies? 
are you guys about finished or are you just goofing off? 
they just copied it all off of you instead of actually doing it?
miguel, sit down. 
audrey, put them away.
audrey, sit down.
cindy, could you go sit in your actual seat? 
cindy, can you wash that off your hand, please. 
pass that one back to matt, would you?
audrey, put that away or I'm gonna read it out loud to everybody. 
stop. 
stop.
gather your stuff.
let's go, folks. 
come on, you guys. 
let's go.
come on, miguel.
just wait. 
stay away. 
come here.
come on, you guys.
come on, Ian. 
carly, watch your mouth, please. 
matt, find your seat. 
can you do that for me, please.
I need your attention up here, please.
folks, I need your attention up here, please.
I'm glad you guys are having so much fun coloring inside the letters, but if I could get your attention up here, I would really appreciate it. 
come here. 
you need to sit down.
you need to write down tonight's homework assignment. 
I hate when you guys do that.
cindy, once it's washed off, you can sit down. 
every single day I would like you to act like perfect kids.
if today is the best you can do for being perfect, i'll take it. 
you're standing there with the door wide open. 
hey, folks. 
oh, that's so helpful.
okay, folks.
that's enough, Miguel. 
you guys remember the polymer, the newspaper polymer, do you guys remember that? ?
do you guys remember that? ?
poly means many. 
you can use this for a test.
they're gigantic molecules. 
mono means one. 
mono [//] okay, polymers are molecules joined together. 
they're around one another and they're linked together. 
thank you, a chain.
okay, we can write: mer@k. 
I was trying to kinda remember, remember “molecule” okay? ?
kinda like crisscrossed. 
you could rip it very, very easily. 
get what? 
yes? 
okay? 
fifty to sixty four is ten? 
so it would have been fourteen centimeters, right?
but you're gonna find that for most of the pull setups it's not the same, okay? 
yeah. 
that's the plan.
okay. 
there you go.
cool. 
okay. 
okay, that's cool. 
I see. 
I see. 
yeah. 
that's it.
that's it.
yeah. 
okay, thanks. 
uh, yes. 
yes, thank you.
there we go.
okay. 
okay. 
okay. 
okay. 
that would be fine. 
that [//] that's fine.
there it is right there. 
and you're all set. 
sure. 
okay. 
okay. 
that's it. 
so there you go.
okay. 
that's great. 
okay. 
that would be fine.
okay. 
all right. 
yep. 
yeah. 
yep. 
all right.
okay. 
yep. 
that's fine.
yeah, that's effort distance.
okay. 
yeah. 
that's it.
that's cool.
yes, ma'am. 
what is a monomer?
so mono means what?
what are they linked together in, samantha?
and then how's the other one?
that's your monomeer, you take a whole bunch of monomers together and what have you created? ?
does anybody here know what tetra means?
anybody here know what “tetra” means? ?
but give me kind of a definition of a monomer
which one is number one, justin? 
which one of those is number one?
well, the little ones are what? 
that's effort force.
not duct tape, plumber's tape.
and what's so important about mono?
they were parallel and because they were arranged parallel what could you what could you do to the newspaper? ?
and how were the molecules arranged in the tyvek?
they're crisscross, and what did the crisscross molecules do to the tyvek? ?
and how that kinda helps us determine what is ac [//] actually gonna happen to the polymer; how is the polymer gonna behave? ?
what about over here on this side of the room? ?
why? 
what did you leave it up there for?
so what's the difference between fifty seven and forty one? 
so they come in two kinds, manmade and natural. 
okay, tetra is a number.
usually what happens up in here is that they'll actually tell you how many of those, uh, molecules are actually bonded together. 
and, that's what I use it for, to fix gas leaks and also it's really, really good for uh, water pipes and threading things like that, too.
so it's how far you exert the force.
it's the distance over which you apply the effort.
that's what effort distance is. 
so if you start here and extend it that far, that's the effort distance. 
how far we pull this to lift the weight ten centimeters is our effort distance. 
you tie a loop in the string and pull down when you're lifting the weight up. 
so when that's being lifted ten centimeters, you want to know how far you had to pull this down.
has anybody here ever fooled around with plumber's tape before? ?
jim, share your experiences with plumber's tape.
did that tell me anything about how the chains were?
someone in here raise your hand and tell me what you think this tells you about how the polymer chains are arranged. ?
what does this tell you? ?
then how come there's not a series of marks? 
i don't think so. 
no, you didn't. 
that's not how it works. 
no. 
now, do you see the tape? ?
does anybody want to take a look at the plumber's tape? ?
and tell me what happens. ?
touch it and you can actually see how flimsy this is, too.
see, it kinda makes a cute little ribbon. 
see these white spots here?
did you find [//] you didn't get one moving west.
somebody else?
do you remember?
okay, ladies and gents somebody in here raise your hand and tell me something that you've learned about polymers. ?
something that you know about polymers, based on last class period. ?
something that you know about polymers.
so, um, you learned about manmade versus natural polymers?
anybody else?
anything else you want to add to this?
do you remember?
can somebody here tell me how were the chains arranged in the newspaper?
how were the chains arranged?
okay, what was the other thing that we used in class?
you guys remember that when we kinda drew this picture of nylon last class period?
what [//] how did that newspaper behave? ?
how did the newspaper behave as far as tearing is concerned? ?
did you learn anything about how the chains were aligned in the tape? ?
because we had a minimum day that day so we took notes, and played around with two polymers. 
but with the ones that we talked about were in chains, okay? ?
samantha mentioned that the polymers can kind of in chains [//] can kinda be arranged two different ways. 
she said, “side to side” and we'll call that “parallel” today. 
we know the polymer chains can be arranged two different ways.
they can be arranged parallel to one another, or they can be arranged crisscross. 
that's what we used this morning for threading, water pipes and stuff like that. ?
just like gave you stuff, remember? 
like candy bars and sodas, remember? 
what is it for every experiment that we're doing? 
the resistance force is just how much the resistance weighs, and as you guys just said a second ago, we are measuring it in what? 
like we learned how to do on monday. 
I remember somebody paid like three thousand dollars for a cup of soup or something like that, remember, in the secret bags. 
remember the ones we rolled up and stapled shut. 
we went over this yesterday. 
we went over [//] we went over resistance distance.
the forces [//] I went over those yesterday. 
in other words, daphne, if I were to ask you what is a monomer, what would you tell me? ?
I mean if you have to describe what they look like when they were joined together what would you tell me? ?
but what's the resistance distance?
what are the little ones?
I have no idea what you are talking about. 
but if you want to take a whole bunch of monomers and link them together what have you kind of created? ?
but if I were to pull like this I would have my name &nice nice and original again; normal again. 
how far would that be?
how far would that be?
audrey, let's say you started there, and by the time that thing was ten centimeters off the ground you were here. How far did it move?
I started at fifty, I went down to forty four. how far did it move?
started at fifty, and I went to sixty four. how far did it go?
say, you started at fifty five, and you pulled the string down to sixty on the ruler. 
say, you started at fifty five, and it went to forty five.
if you pull straight down, you'll get much more accurate measurements.
if you do it off to the side, it just, uh [//] it's not gonna be as accurate, and again estimate to the closest quarter. 
it's just you have to pull a lot more string through if you put the [//] better bring the string through first.
you're getting it. 
well, you're really close.
don't worry about that yet. 
and I'm gonna see whether or not you guys can remember that. 
and we're gonna take this one step further today in class. 
we're gonna talk about parallel and cross linked chains and what actually does that do to the polymer. 
kind of a r [//] kind of a review from what we did last class period, but also to let you know where we're going with the lesson today. 
okay, this is what we're gonna concentrate on in class today.
and you're going to investigate a polymer on your own, with your group. 
actually, it just does it by, whe [//] eh, you're gonna figure that out. 
the job is now to figure out how the polymer chains are arranged. 
so we're gonna have to do a couple of things to it to try to figure out how the polymer chains are inside the teflon or inside the plumber's tape. ?
okay, and this, ladies and gents, is what we're gonna focus on today, okay? ?
so you put all of these together and you'll get them all in a nice big old polymer chain and you create plumber's tape. 
the only thing that I'd like for you to do with the plumber's tape when you get it, is just to kinda leave it on your desk. 
I'd just like to go out and get the sunspots real quick.
then I'm gonna pass out a piece of paper to you.
and i'll pass out compasses so that we can get the sun's shape drawn before we head outside. 
and it'll probably be about one thirty or twelve thirty when we have them set up out there. 
we'll all go back in in about a minute or so.
we're gonna get started on the lab today.
you'll be using both of them at the same time. 
one person is gonna be measuring resistance distance; one person is gonna be measuring effort distance. 
so you'll have one person using the centimeter side of the ruler. 
they're gonna be measuring how high the bottom of the weight goes up.
is gonna be measuring how far they have moved the string to raise the weight ten centimeters. 
a couple things to be aware of when you're doing your measurements. 
so you want to make sure that you're pulling straight down in the direction that you are measuring. 
secondly, you want to make sure that, uh, when you're measuring the force you're also pulling straight down. 
straight down really helps on this lab. 
and you're gonna pull, and it works again much better if you pull upside down. 
you're not gonna get them all done today. 
you might not even get the first one done today.
it's better that you get accurate data than that you just rush through all of these. 
we're gonna spend a number of days on this. 
at this time I'm gonna divide you up into ten groups and send you to a station.
get started on [//] well, you can do any of the pulley setups you want. 
it doesn't matter whether you start with the first one or not, but let me sort of divide you guys up here. 
um, diane, you guys are gonna be here on the other side of this first station.
cassandra, you guys will be on this side of the first station. 
carly, you guys will be across from matt's group. 
audrey, you guys will be at this third station over here.
you guys will be just across from that. 
sheila and eleanor, you guys will be where cindy is, working at that station. 
and, josh and muriel, you'll be just across from that. 
and [//] let's see [//] andrew and zeb, you guys will be at this station back here, and you guys will be at the very last station on the end. 
we're gonna do that together once we got our data.
yes, I think that would be a wise idea. 
if I were you I'd kinda go over your notes a little bit, too. 
okay, well then you need to go and get the notes from somebody in class, okay? ?
to try to get as much information as you can about polymers because what can you do with this sheet of paper, that i'll let you do? ?
so what I'd like for you to do, is that you have the tape like this, lengthwise on your desk [//] everybody, jason, got it?
and if you would do me a favor and put your notebook on the floor, so the only thing that should be on your desk is a piece of notebook paper. ?
don't do anything to it other than just leave it on your desk. ?
then don't, don't do that, then if it's ripping through, cause it's not a good thing. ?
don't stretch it out to the point where you're gonna tear it, but go along your tape and ever so gently stretch it out. ?
now what I want you to do, is take one end and take the other end and I want you ever so gently to stretch it that way. ?
okay, do I have any others of these pages? 
did we get them tracked west?
so you guys haven't done yours yet?
where's yours? 
are we gonna mark our sunspots and track them west?
where did you start? 
where did you end?
depending on how you turned, how far would that be? 
is there anything over fifty? 
how did you get effort distance on there, zeb? 
which one? 
you're supposed to actually measure some stuff along the way, and what would that be? 
what's that? 
and how far are you supposed to lift it? 
how far did it move? 
which part are you guys stuck on here?
can I have any others?
write down tonight's homework assignment. 
on page one forty nine, I'd like you to do questions one through four, please. 
and as always write out the questions and the answers.
take two, pass it back. 
take two, and pass the rest back. 
set the compass at four and a half centimeters, please. 
separate them in two halves, take about an inch off the bottom, please. 
draw your sun circle about in the center. 
fold it in half, turn. 
please do both circles because I don't want to have to do this again tomorrow.
let's get them separated, get the covers off, and find a space in the sun.
okay, put circles on both data pieces, today and tomorrow. 
put sunspots at the top, name, date, and the period, and the time of twelve thirty, which is about when we will be out there. 
tops off.
let's get the stands from the telescopes and head on out.
bring them outside.
find a spot in the sun.
mark your sunspots and track one moving west, please. 
please be careful with them. 
please mark your sunspots and track one of them moving west. 
you need to track one of them moving west. 
you got to mark them, and that way will show you the direction west.
you got to mark not only your sunspots.
you also have to track them moving west so you know which way your image is oriented so please track one of your sunspots moving west. 
let's get your telescopes and bring them back in. 
put them together, get the covers on, bring them back up to my desk. 
let's get them back together, cases on. 
bring them up front.
justin, would you collect all the compasses? 
please send the compasses to the front of the room so justin can pick those up. 
I need you guys to take out the lab sheet that we went over yesterday, please. 
folks, get your labs.
find your spots, please.
just quickly go over this for the first setup again. 
don't use the inches; use the centimeters. 
pull straight down. 
let's head to our stations.
take your data table.
let's get them set up and get to work.
go ahead and put fifty on there. 
you're gonna want to get those out. 
you probably want to put the loop through. 
you got to measure [/] measure it while you do it, audrey. 
tie a knot in the string. 
pull it with the scale. 
read the reading in newtons.
pass everything back.
weigh this thing.
lastly, lift this ten centimeters off the ground by pulling here.
any of these areas in the full sun is fine as long as you're not behind tree shadows.
it needs [//] monica, it needs a little adjustment just so it'll get it more centered. 
so can you tilt it left and right so that the shadow goes away
okay, now you got shadow on this side, okay? 
now you just need to tilt it a little bit to make [//] there you go.
now, you should be able to see spots here. 
if you line those up in the center of the target, you should have your sun.
all I need is in the center of the target, see.
now you need to mark them. 
the direction that the sunspots move. 
when you put it on there, you're supposed to let the sun move and make a mark for one of your sunspots as it moves. 
you're just gathering three pieces of data from each pulley setup. 
you're gathering the effort distance, the effort force and the resistance force. 
when you lift the weight by ten centimeters. 
the resistance distance in every case is ten centimeters. 
there are two rulers back at the station. 
when it's at ten centimeters, that's as far as you're going. 
now, some people in earlier classes were just writing down the numbers on here. 
but it has to be straight down, and you have to know where you started. 
but you got to hold it somewhere so that you can pull. 
p+o+l+y, poly, and that gives you a really, really good idea that that must be a polymer because it has p+o+l+y on it. 
so I'd start at something even.

in other words, what does it mean?
in other words, how does it work?
in other words, what would would you call it?
quiet, please.
be quiet.
please stop talking.
please pay attention.
eyes up here, please.
please focus on what we're doing.
attention!
please look at the board.
look at the board.
look at me.
listen to me.
pay attention to me.
I need you to pay attention.
I need you to listen.
and you look at all the names of the polymers, what's at the beginning of all the names of the [//] of the chemical names of the polymers? ?
yeah, they're simple molecules, so if we take the simple molecules, daphne, we put them all together inside of a chain, what have we created? ?
and they're joined together, how are they joined together?
do you guys know what I'm talking about?
were they more arranged parallel or were they arranged crisscross? ?
do you think the chains are arranged parallel to one another or do you think they're crisscrossed? ?
scrunched together kinda like? ?
you kind of gave it to me, but kind of rephrase that.
are you talking about this thing right there? 
that's force, as in newtons. 
don't kill each other. 
go away, jeffrey.
what do you need, miguel?
did you go find audrey's stuff yet? 
are you planning on doing some rude symbol while my back is turned?
uh, you can actually draw a line through jack's name on there and, uh [//] was that it for this class that transferred to the high school? 
audrey, what are you doing going into other people's classrooms? 
what are you doing?
ladies? 
are you guys about finished or are you just goofing off? 
they just copied it all off of you instead of actually doing it?
miguel, sit down. 
audrey, put them away.
audrey, sit down.
cindy, could you go sit in your actual seat? 
cindy, can you wash that off your hand, please. 
pass that one back to matt, would you?
audrey, put that away or I'm gonna read it out loud to everybody. 
stop. 
stop.
gather your stuff.
let's go, folks. 
come on, you guys. 
let's go.
come on, miguel.
just wait. 
stay away. 
come here.
come on, you guys.
come on, Ian. 
carly, watch your mouth, please. 
matt, find your seat. 
can you do that for me, please.
I need your attention up here, please.
folks, I need your attention up here, please.
I'm glad you guys are having so much fun coloring inside the letters, but if I could get your attention up here, I would really appreciate it. 
come here. 
you need to sit down.
you need to write down tonight's homework assignment. 
I hate when you guys do that.
cindy, once it's washed off, you can sit down. 
every single day I would like you to act like perfect kids.
if today is the best you can do for being perfect, i'll take it. 
you're standing there with the door wide open. 
hey, folks. 
oh, that's so helpful.
okay, folks.
that's enough, Miguel. 
you guys remember the polymer, the newspaper polymer, do you guys remember that? ?
do you guys remember that? ?
poly means many. 
you can use this for a test.
they're gigantic molecules. 
mono means one. 
mono [//] okay, polymers are molecules joined together. 
they're around one another and they're linked together. 
thank you, a chain.
okay, we can write: mer@k. 
I was trying to kinda remember, remember “molecule” okay? ?
kinda like crisscrossed. 
you could rip it very, very easily. 
get what? 
yes? 
okay? 
fifty to sixty four is ten? 
so it would have been fourteen centimeters, right?
but you're gonna find that for most of the pull setups it's not the same, okay? 
yeah. 
that's the plan.
okay. 
there you go.
cool. 
okay. 
okay, that's cool. 
I see. 
I see. 
yeah. 
that's it.
that's it.
yeah. 
okay, thanks. 
uh, yes. 
yes, thank you.
there we go.
okay. 
okay. 
okay. 
okay. 
that would be fine. 
that [//] that's fine.
there it is right there. 
and you're all set. 
sure. 
okay. 
okay. 
that's it. 
so there you go.
okay. 
that's great. 
okay. 
that would be fine.
okay. 
all right. 
yep. 
yeah. 
yep. 
all right.
okay. 
yep. 
that's fine.
yeah, that's effort distance.
okay. 
yeah. 
that's it.
that's cool.
yes, ma'am. 
what is a monomer?
so mono means what?
what are they linked together in, samantha?
and then how's the other one?
that's your monomeer, you take a whole bunch of monomers together and what have you created? ?
does anybody here know what tetra means?
anybody here know what “tetra” means? ?
but give me kind of a definition of a monomer
which one is number one, justin? 
which one of those is number one?
well, the little ones are what? 
that's effort force.
not duct tape, plumber's tape.
and what's so important about mono?
they were parallel and because they were arranged parallel what could you what could you do to the newspaper? ?
and how were the molecules arranged in the tyvek?
they're crisscross, and what did the crisscross molecules do to the tyvek? ?
and how that kinda helps us determine what is ac [//] actually gonna happen to the polymer; how is the polymer gonna behave? ?
what about over here on this side of the room? ?
why? 
what did you leave it up there for?
so what's the difference between fifty seven and forty one? 
so they come in two kinds, manmade and natural. 
okay, tetra is a number.
usually what happens up in here is that they'll actually tell you how many of those, uh, molecules are actually bonded together. 
and, that's what I use it for, to fix gas leaks and also it's really, really good for uh, water pipes and threading things like that, too.
so it's how far you exert the force.
it's the distance over which you apply the effort.
that's what effort distance is. 
so if you start here and extend it that far, that's the effort distance. 
how far we pull this to lift the weight ten centimeters is our effort distance. 
you tie a loop in the string and pull down when you're lifting the weight up. 
so when that's being lifted ten centimeters, you want to know how far you had to pull this down.
has anybody here ever fooled around with plumber's tape before? ?
jim, share your experiences with plumber's tape.
did that tell me anything about how the chains were?
someone in here raise your hand and tell me what you think this tells you about how the polymer chains are arranged. ?
what does this tell you? ?
then how come there's not a series of marks? 
i don't think so. 
no, you didn't. 
that's not how it works. 
no. 
now, do you see the tape? ?
does anybody want to take a look at the plumber's tape? ?
and tell me what happens. ?
touch it and you can actually see how flimsy this is, too.
see, it kinda makes a cute little ribbon. 
see these white spots here?
did you find [//] you didn't get one moving west.
somebody else?
do you remember?
okay, ladies and gents somebody in here raise your hand and tell me something that you've learned about polymers. ?
something that you know about polymers, based on last class period. ?
something that you know about polymers.
so, um, you learned about manmade versus natural polymers?
anybody else?
anything else you want to add to this?
do you remember?
can somebody here tell me how were the chains arranged in the newspaper?
how were the chains arranged?
okay, what was the other thing that we used in class?
you guys remember that when we kinda drew this picture of nylon last class period?
what [//] how did that newspaper behave? ?
how did the newspaper behave as far as tearing is concerned? ?
did you learn anything about how the chains were aligned in the tape? ?
because we had a minimum day that day so we took notes, and played around with two polymers. 
but with the ones that we talked about were in chains, okay? ?
samantha mentioned that the polymers can kind of in chains [//] can kinda be arranged two different ways. 
she said, “side to side” and we'll call that “parallel” today. 
we know the polymer chains can be arranged two different ways.
they can be arranged parallel to one another, or they can be arranged crisscross. 
that's what we used this morning for threading, water pipes and stuff like that. ?
just like gave you stuff, remember? 
like candy bars and sodas, remember? 
what is it for every experiment that we're doing? 
the resistance force is just how much the resistance weighs, and as you guys just said a second ago, we are measuring it in what? 
like we learned how to do on monday. 
I remember somebody paid like three thousand dollars for a cup of soup or something like that, remember, in the secret bags. 
remember the ones we rolled up and stapled shut. 
we went over this yesterday. 
we went over [//] we went over resistance distance.
the forces [//] I went over those yesterday. 
in other words, daphne, if I were to ask you what is a monomer, what would you tell me? ?
I mean if you have to describe what they look like when they were joined together what would you tell me? ?
but what's the resistance distance?
what are the little ones?
I have no idea what you are talking about. 
but if you want to take a whole bunch of monomers and link them together what have you kind of created? ?
but if I were to pull like this I would have my name &nice nice and original again; normal again. 
how far would that be?
how far would that be?
audrey, let's say you started there, and by the time that thing was ten centimeters off the ground you were here. How far did it move?
I started at fifty, I went down to forty four. how far did it move?
started at fifty, and I went to sixty four. how far did it go?
say, you started at fifty five, and you pulled the string down to sixty on the ruler. 
say, you started at fifty five, and it went to forty five.
if you pull straight down, you'll get much more accurate measurements.
if you do it off to the side, it just, uh [//] it's not gonna be as accurate, and again estimate to the closest quarter. 
it's just you have to pull a lot more string through if you put the [//] better bring the string through first.
you're getting it. 
well, you're really close.
don't worry about that yet. 
and I'm gonna see whether or not you guys can remember that. 
and we're gonna take this one step further today in class. 
we're gonna talk about parallel and cross linked chains and what actually does that do to the polymer. 
kind of a r [//] kind of a review from what we did last class period, but also to let you know where we're going with the lesson today. 
okay, this is what we're gonna concentrate on in class today.
and you're going to investigate a polymer on your own, with your group. 
actually, it just does it by, whe [//] eh, you're gonna figure that out. 
the job is now to figure out how the polymer chains are arranged. 
so we're gonna have to do a couple of things to it to try to figure out how the polymer chains are inside the teflon or inside the plumber's tape. ?
okay, and this, ladies and gents, is what we're gonna focus on today, okay? ?
so you put all of these together and you'll get them all in a nice big old polymer chain and you create plumber's tape. 
the only thing that I'd like for you to do with the plumber's tape when you get it, is just to kinda leave it on your desk. 
I'd just like to go out and get the sunspots real quick.
then I'm gonna pass out a piece of paper to you.
and i'll pass out compasses so that we can get the sun's shape drawn before we head outside. 
and it'll probably be about one thirty or twelve thirty when we have them set up out there. 
we'll all go back in in about a minute or so.
we're gonna get started on the lab today.
you'll be using both of them at the same time. 
one person is gonna be measuring resistance distance; one person is gonna be measuring effort distance. 
so you'll have one person using the centimeter side of the ruler. 
they're gonna be measuring how high the bottom of the weight goes up.
is gonna be measuring how far they have moved the string to raise the weight ten centimeters. 
a couple things to be aware of when you're doing your measurements. 
so you want to make sure that you're pulling straight down in the direction that you are measuring. 
secondly, you want to make sure that, uh, when you're measuring the force you're also pulling straight down. 
straight down really helps on this lab. 
and you're gonna pull, and it works again much better if you pull upside down. 
you're not gonna get them all done today. 
you might not even get the first one done today.
it's better that you get accurate data than that you just rush through all of these. 
we're gonna spend a number of days on this. 
at this time I'm gonna divide you up into ten groups and send you to a station.
get started on [//] well, you can do any of the pulley setups you want. 
it doesn't matter whether you start with the first one or not, but let me sort of divide you guys up here. 
um, diane, you guys are gonna be here on the other side of this first station.
cassandra, you guys will be on this side of the first station. 
carly, you guys will be across from matt's group. 
audrey, you guys will be at this third station over here.
you guys will be just across from that. 
sheila and eleanor, you guys will be where cindy is, working at that station. 
and, josh and muriel, you'll be just across from that. 
and [//] let's see [//] andrew and zeb, you guys will be at this station back here, and you guys will be at the very last station on the end. 
we're gonna do that together once we got our data.
yes, I think that would be a wise idea. 
if I were you I'd kinda go over your notes a little bit, too. 
okay, well then you need to go and get the notes from somebody in class, okay? ?
to try to get as much information as you can about polymers because what can you do with this sheet of paper, that i'll let you do? ?
so what I'd like for you to do, is that you have the tape like this, lengthwise on your desk [//] everybody, jason, got it?
and if you would do me a favor and put your notebook on the floor, so the only thing that should be on your desk is a piece of notebook paper. ?
don't do anything to it other than just leave it on your desk. ?
then don't, don't do that, then if it's ripping through, cause it's not a good thing. ?
don't stretch it out to the point where you're gonna tear it, but go along your tape and ever so gently stretch it out. ?
now what I want you to do, is take one end and take the other end and I want you ever so gently to stretch it that way. ?
okay, do I have any others of these pages? 
did we get them tracked west?
so you guys haven't done yours yet?
where's yours? 
are we gonna mark our sunspots and track them west?
where did you start? 
where did you end?
depending on how you turned, how far would that be? 
is there anything over fifty? 
how did you get effort distance on there, zeb? 
which one? 
you're supposed to actually measure some stuff along the way, and what would that be? 
what's that? 
and how far are you supposed to lift it? 
how far did it move? 
which part are you guys stuck on here?
can I have any others?
write down tonight's homework assignment. 
on page one forty nine, I'd like you to do questions one through four, please. 
and as always write out the questions and the answers.
take two, pass it back. 
take two, and pass the rest back. 
set the compass at four and a half centimeters, please. 
separate them in two halves, take about an inch off the bottom, please. 
draw your sun circle about in the center. 
fold it in half, turn. 
please do both circles because I don't want to have to do this again tomorrow.
let's get them separated, get the covers off, and find a space in the sun.
okay, put circles on both data pieces, today and tomorrow. 
put sunspots at the top, name, date, and the period, and the time of twelve thirty, which is about when we will be out there. 
tops off.
let's get the stands from the telescopes and head on out.
bring them outside.
find a spot in the sun.
mark your sunspots and track one moving west, please. 
please be careful with them. 
please mark your sunspots and track one of them moving west. 
you need to track one of them moving west. 
you got to mark them, and that way will show you the direction west.
you got to mark not only your sunspots.
you also have to track them moving west so you know which way your image is oriented so please track one of your sunspots moving west. 
let's get your telescopes and bring them back in. 
put them together, get the covers on, bring them back up to my desk. 
let's get them back together, cases on. 
bring them up front.
justin, would you collect all the compasses? 
please send the compasses to the front of the room so justin can pick those up. 
I need you guys to take out the lab sheet that we went over yesterday, please. 
folks, get your labs.
find your spots, please.
just quickly go over this for the first setup again. 
don't use the inches; use the centimeters. 
pull straight down. 
let's head to our stations.
take your data table.
let's get them set up and get to work.
go ahead and put fifty on there. 
you're gonna want to get those out. 
you probably want to put the loop through. 
you got to measure [/] measure it while you do it, audrey. 
tie a knot in the string. 
pull it with the scale. 
read the reading in newtons.
pass everything back.
weigh this thing.
lastly, lift this ten centimeters off the ground by pulling here.
any of these areas in the full sun is fine as long as you're not behind tree shadows.
it needs [//] monica, it needs a little adjustment just so it'll get it more centered. 
so can you tilt it left and right so that the shadow goes away
okay, now you got shadow on this side, okay? 
now you just need to tilt it a little bit to make [//] there you go.
now, you should be able to see spots here. 
if you line those up in the center of the target, you should have your sun.
all I need is in the center of the target, see.
now you need to mark them. 
the direction that the sunspots move. 
when you put it on there, you're supposed to let the sun move and make a mark for one of your sunspots as it moves. 
you're just gathering three pieces of data from each pulley setup. 
you're gathering the effort distance, the effort force and the resistance force. 
when you lift the weight by ten centimeters. 
the resistance distance in every case is ten centimeters. 
there are two rulers back at the station. 
when it's at ten centimeters, that's as far as you're going. 
now, some people in earlier classes were just writing down the numbers on here. 
but it has to be straight down, and you have to know where you started. 
but you got to hold it somewhere so that you can pull. 
p+o+l+y, poly, and that gives you a really, really good idea that that must be a polymer because it has p+o+l+y on it. 
so I'd start at something even. 
this is useful for your career

you will find this interesting
this is actually fun
